## Scope Check

| Item | In Scope | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Prevalence (% affected) | Yes | Included |
| Severity (time/effort) | Yes | Included |
| Customer voice | Yes | Included — 86 verbatim quotes across 10 themes |
| Current solutions & gaps | Yes | Included |
| Dollar figures | No | Excluded |
| TAM/SAM/SOM | No | Excluded |
| Total user counts | No | Excluded |
| Market growth trends | No | Excluded |
| Opportunity cost calculations | No | Excluded |

**Note:** "$3.7 trillion in unrealized value" appears in thesis.md as severity context (what's at stake for portfolio monitoring), not as a TAM calculation. Case study dollar figures (e.g., "$60B+ in post-close losses," "$23B writedown") describe consequences of DD failures, not market opportunity. Both uses are within scope for Problem workspace.

## Issues

None. All checks pass.

## Notes

- **Round 2 research** added 8 deep-dive research areas: decision science, post-close failures, legal DD workflows, Q&A bottleneck, portfolio monitoring, AI adoption barriers, sell-side burden, and cross-workstream synthesis.
- **New first principle (P6):** Confirmation bias is structurally embedded in deal incentives — supported by HBR, Wangerin (2019), Cassell et al. (2022), WMD Commission, Stanford/Addepar.
- **New functional job (J6):** Q&A coordination across workstreams — supported by Ansarada (90% of questions take 6+ interactions), Excel tracker persistence, verbal findings gap.
- **Three new customer voice themes** added: AI Trust Deficit (Theme 8), Q&A Coordination Nightmare (Theme 9), Cross-Workstream Synthesis (Theme 10).
- **Evidence triangulation** spans cognitive science, insurance claims data, organizational theory, intelligence analysis (9/11 Commission, WMD Commission), medical safety (I-PASS), engineering failure (NASA Columbia), legal practice, and practitioner testimony.
- The **84% audited-target finding** (Euclid Transactional) remains the single most powerful evidence point — it proves the problem is synthesis failure, not missing data.
- The **8 post-close case studies** all follow the same pattern: Document A and Document B each looked unremarkable alone, but their intersection was catastrophic.
