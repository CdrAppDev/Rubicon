independence_check:
  status: "pass"
  detail: "All hypothesis pairs checked; no pair where H_a false implies H_b false"
  notes:
    - "M1 (deal team count) and M3 (contracts per deal) are independent — the number of deals does not determine the number of contracts per deal"
    - "M2 (portfolio companies) and M4 (sell-side burden) are independent — portfolio monitoring and sell-side DD are different workflows"
    - "C1 (buy-side deal teams) and C2 (IC members) are independent — deal teams could be a valid segment even if IC members buy the same tools, and vice versa"
    - "C3 (sell-side) and C1/C2 (buy-side) are independent — sell-side could be a valid segment regardless of buy-side segment structure"
    - "C4 (portfolio monitoring) is independent of C1-C3 — monitoring is a different workflow from deal-based DD"
    - "C5 (W&I underwriters) is independent of all other segments — underwriter needs exist regardless of how other segments are structured"
    - "CP1 (VDRs passive) and CP4 (no cross-workstream synthesis) are related but independent — VDRs could add analytics without solving cross-workstream synthesis, and cross-workstream synthesis could exist outside VDRs"
    - "W1 (labor cost anchor) and W2 (post-close claims anchor) are independent value propositions — labor savings and risk reduction are separately testable"

p2_compliance:
  status: "pass"
  detail: "All 19 hypotheses framed around job executors and job context, not demographics"
  notes:
    - "All market size hypotheses count job executors (deal teams, portfolio companies, management teams) not industry revenue"
    - "All segment hypotheses defined by job execution patterns (which jobs they execute, in what context) not by firm size, geography, or demographics"
    - "All WTP hypotheses anchored to severity data (labor hours, post-close claims, opportunity cost) not to industry pricing benchmarks"

falsifiability:
  status: "pass"
  detail: "All 19 hypotheses have falsifiable: true and contain specific thresholds or testable claims"
  examples:
    - id: M1
      disproof: "Research finds fewer than 50,000 deal teams execute DD annually, or typical data rooms are under 5,000 pages"
    - id: C5
      disproof: "Research finds W&I underwriters do not independently evaluate DD quality or that claim rates are unrelated to DD thoroughness"
    - id: CP2
      disproof: "Research finds first-wave legal AI companies survived independently or that current hallucination rates are below 5%"
    - id: W2
      disproof: "Research finds post-close claim rates are below 10% or that EBITDA-multiple damages are not actually sought"

traceability:
  status: "pass"
  detail: "All 19 hypotheses trace to specific Problem outputs with named references"
  coverage:

  warnings: []
  notes:
    - "Problem evidence is exceptionally rich — thesis, JTBD, and evidence all support multi-segment, multi-job market with strong severity data"
    - "The 4 customer segments (C1-C4) represent genuinely distinct job execution contexts with different done states, plus a downstream buyer (C5) that emerged from W&I claims evidence"
    - "WTP hypotheses are well-anchored to quantitative severity data (labor hours, claim rates, opportunity costs) rather than qualitative willingness signals"
    - "Competitive position hypotheses cover the full landscape: VDRs, first-wave AI tools, manual workarounds, platform gaps, and structural adoption barriers"
