tam:
  population: "~200,000-250,000 active deal professionals annually"
  frequency: "3-8 deals per professional per year (varying by role and deal size)"
  unit_of_analysis: "job_executors"
  methodology_note: >
    No direct census of active M&A deal professionals exists. This estimate is derived from
    transaction counts (PwC, 2026) multiplied by observed team sizes (PEI, 2025; Devensoft, 2025),
    with a deduplication adjustment for professionals working multiple deals concurrently.
    The range (200K-250K) reflects uncertainty in the overlap factor. The deal count inputs
    (47,000-50,000 transactions) and team size inputs (5-15 professionals) are sourced from
    third-party data; the deduplication adjustment is an analytical inference.
  description: >
    Total population of professionals executing M&A due diligence jobs (J1-J6) globally.
    Includes PE associates, IB analysts, Big Law attorneys, Big 4 consultants, corporate
    development professionals, and operating partners engaged in deal-based DD or portfolio
    monitoring. Sized by job executor count, not industry revenue.
  calculation: >
    47,000-50,000 M&A transactions annually (PwC, 2026) x 5-15 professionals per deal team
    = 235,000-750,000 deal team positions annually. Adjusted for overlap (same professionals
    working multiple deals): ~200,000-250,000 unique active deal professionals at any given time.
    Additionally, ~10,000 operating partners executing portfolio monitoring (J4) across
    25,000-35,000 portfolio companies.

  population: "~15,000-25,000 reachable deal professionals"
  rationale: >
    From SAM of 150,000-180,000, three sequential filters narrow to the reachable subset:
    (1) Geographic filter — North America represents ~40-50% of SAM (US accounts for <25% of deal
    volumes but >50% of deal value per PwC, 2026), yielding 60,000-90,000 professionals.
    (2) Deal size filter — mid-market ($50M-$1B) transactions represent ~40-50% of North American
    subset, yielding 24,000-45,000 professionals. Mid-market is the highest-density segment for
    cross-workstream synthesis needs.
    (3) Reachability filter — accounting for 14-36 week sales cycles per firm (Alexander Jarvis, 2025),
    land-and-expand adoption timelines (WEF, 2025), and SOC 2 timing constraints (EasyAudit.ai, 2025),
    ~50-60% of filtered population is reachable within 18 months, yielding 15,000-25,000 professionals.
    Channels: industry conferences (SuperReturn, PEI Operating Partners Forum, ILTACON),
    M&A advisor referral networks, pilot-to-rollout land-and-expand pattern.
