# Due diligence is broken — and the data proves it

**The evidence overwhelmingly validates the core pain points in AI-powered due diligence.** Across six hypotheses tested against industry surveys, insurance claims data, and founder research, five receive strong empirical support, one receives moderate support, and several findings reveal problems deeper than any single hypothesis captures. The most striking discovery: **84% of financial statement breach claims involve companies with audited financials**, suggesting that even existing quality controls systematically fail to catch material issues buried in document complexity. With **30–38% of private M&A deals generating post-close indemnification claims** and **83% of PE leaders** acknowledging their due diligence approach needs substantial improvement, the problem is not hypothetical — it is the industry's default operating condition.

## H1 validated: manual review dominates despite massive document volumes

The hypothesis that due diligence teams manually review thousands of unstructured documents under tight timelines finds strong support. Mid-market M&A data rooms contain **5,000–50,000+ pages** of documents, and due diligence windows typically span just **30–90 days**. The vast majority of this content is unstructured: Gartner estimates that **80–90% of all enterprise data** consists of PDFs, Word documents, emails, and spreadsheets — the exact formats that populate deal data rooms.

Automation remains the exception, not the rule. Only **26% of companies** use mostly automated methods to analyze their content, according to IDC research. While Deloitte's 2025 GenAI in M&A Survey found that 86% of organizations have now integrated GenAI into M&A workflows, only **35% of those adopters use it for due diligence specifically** — and 65% adopted GenAI only within the past year, confirming that manual review was near-universal as recently as mid-2024. A separate survey from the Investment Banking Council of America found that only **16% of M&A professionals** currently use generative AI in due diligence. EY notes that many companies still store key documents in physical formats, adding further manual effort.

**Evidence assessment:** Strong validation. Multiple independent sources confirm that manual document review remains the primary method, document volumes are large, and timelines are compressed. This is not merely a process inefficiency — it is the structural condition that enables the failures documented in H2 and H3.

## H2 validated: financial anomalies surface after close at alarming rates

The hypothesis that risk signals go undetected because reviewers cannot systematically cross-reference information across large document sets receives the strongest quantitative validation of any hypothesis tested. SRS Acquiom's analysis of **700+ private-target acquisitions** valued at approximately $159 billion found that **30–38% of all deals experience at least one post-close indemnification claim**. Separately, **~20% of representation and warranty insurance (RWI) policies** result in claims, according to AIG and Euclid Transactional data.

The types of issues missed are precisely those that require cross-referencing. **Financial statement breaches represent 37% of all losses paid** under RWI policies, followed by material contracts (31%) and compliance with law (12%). Revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and carve-out accounting errors are consistently the most common origins of financial statement claims. AIG reports that **38% of all claim notifications relate to accounting issues** (financial statements plus tax), rising to 46% for claims exceeding $1 million.

Perhaps the most damning finding: Euclid Transactional reports that **84% of financial statement breach claims involve companies with audited financials**, and **90% of total paid losses** come from deals with audits. This is not a problem of missing audits — it is a problem of human reviewers failing to connect disparate data points across thousands of pages, even when professional auditors have already reviewed the numbers. Standard review processes simply cannot systematically cross-reference information at the scale required.

The timing data reinforces this. **49% of RWI claims occur more than 12 months post-closing**, with Liberty GTS reporting a significant jump to **44% of claims being reported after 18 months** — up from 24% the prior year. Issues that should have been caught during due diligence take months or years to surface.

**Evidence assessment:** Strong validation. This hypothesis is supported by hard claims data (not survey opinion), making it among the most robustly evidenced. The root cause appears to be the inability to systematically synthesize information across large, unstructured document sets — making H2 both a standalone problem and a direct consequence of H1 and H3.

## H3 validated: information retrieval failures drive incomplete analysis

The hypothesis that finding specific information across thousands of unstructured pages requires excessive time is closely related to H1 but deserves separate evaluation because it highlights the *search and retrieval* problem specifically. One vendor survey (DiligenceVault) estimates the average diligence analyst spends roughly **37% of their time hunting through emails, files, and spreadsheets** — though this figure should be treated as directional given its vendor origin. More robustly, Deloitte's 2019 survey found that only **18% of organizations** can take advantage of unstructured data at all, and IDC found only 26% have automated content analysis.

McKinsey's research provides the sharpest evidence of the consequences: due diligence **overlooks as much as 50% of potential merger value** and is **inadequate in more than 40% of deals**. Bain & Company found that **~60% of executives attributed deal failure to poor due diligence** that did not identify critical issues. The SBAI's 2024 Operational Due Diligence Practices Survey found that "a sizeable minority" of ODD professionals stated they do not always have time to comprehensively complete their reviews and have felt **under duress to approve managers despite risks uncovered** — a finding that directly ties time pressure to incomplete analysis.

**Evidence assessment:** Strong validation. H3 is best understood not as independent from H1 but as its most damaging consequence. The root problem is that unstructured documents are not searchable, cross-referenceable, or analyzable at scale — making it physically impossible for human reviewers to find everything relevant within deal timelines.

## H4 moderately supported: silos are real but hard to quantify precisely

No single authoritative survey directly measures the percentage of firms with "fragmented" due diligence workflows using that terminology. However, convergent evidence from multiple sources paints a clear picture. Deloitte found that acquirers who relied on siloed advisers were **almost twice as dissatisfied** with their ability to synthesize diligence findings compared to those using integrated approaches. Approximately **one-third of respondents** in Deloitte's 2024 Global Corporate Divestiture Survey said stakeholder misalignment delayed their most recent transactions, with tasks being handed off "from silo to silo, an inefficiency that can erode transaction value."

Structurally, **30% of institutional investors lack dedicated operational due diligence teams**, according to the SBAI's 2024 survey of 44 firms representing over $2 trillion in AUM. Among those without dedicated teams, **77% rely on external consultants** for ODD support — adding another coordination layer. The existence of ILPA's standardized DDQ (their most downloaded document) was created specifically because "customized DDQs, which have varying content and length, have created an **extraordinary administrative burden** on all interested parties."

Deloitte's Center for Board Effectiveness specifically warns of committee "balkanization" in M&A governance, where "each committee is pursuing its own inquiries, but the 'dots' may not be connected." This echoes the **40% of PE respondents** who told Accenture they see discovery of unexpected gaps in portfolio company capabilities as a top challenge — gaps that a more integrated diligence process might have caught.

**Evidence assessment:** Moderate validation. The qualitative evidence is strong and consistent, but hard percentage data on workflow fragmentation specifically is scarce. This hypothesis may be better characterized as a *symptom* of the deeper problem that due diligence lacks a unified data layer — teams fragment because the documents and information they work with are fragmented.

## H5 validated: quarterly reporting with multi-month lags creates structural blind spots

Portfolio monitoring gaps are well-documented and deeply structural. ILPA's Quarterly Reporting Standards set delivery expectations at **60 days after quarter-end** (target: 45 days), with fund-of-funds getting up to **90 days**. Allvue Systems notes that most PE managers report performance "delayed by **one to two quarters**." Combined with the quarterly cadence itself, investors may go **4–5 months** between receiving meaningful performance updates.

The infrastructure underlying this reporting is strikingly primitive. A Preqin survey of 300 private capital fund managers found that **46% relied exclusively on Microsoft Excel** to monitor their portfolios. PwC's Next In survey found that **54% of PE portfolio companies use email with an attachment** to submit data, and 36% simply write a text-only email response. Deloitte states bluntly that many firms **"cannot reliably collect and integrate trusted data regularly"** from portfolio companies due to limited infrastructure, process challenges, and lacking data governance. Manual collection pushes reporting cycles out by an additional **2–3 weeks** beyond the already-delayed quarterly cadence.

LP demand for better visibility is intensifying. **80% of investors expect higher levels of transparency** from fund managers, according to Intertrust Group. Preqin research confirms that LP expectations for reporting frequency and depth have "increased significantly over the past five years." McKinsey's data shows monitoring time has actually *declined* from 29% to **19% of operating group time** between 2015 and 2018, even as operational value creation now drives **47% of PE returns** — a disconnect that makes real-time visibility more critical than ever.

**Evidence assessment:** Strong validation. The monitoring gap is structural (quarterly cadence + multi-month lag + spreadsheet-based infrastructure) rather than merely a technology adoption problem. The deeper issue is that PE's shift toward operational value creation demands continuous visibility, but reporting infrastructure remains stuck in a quarterly-batch paradigm.

## H6 validated: fundraising consumes founder time at scale

The Angel Investment Network's 2025 survey of 610 US founders found that **46% spend 30% or more of their week on fundraising**, with **25% spending over half their week** solely on fundraising activities. Critically, **45% of founders say this time commitment is impacting their ability to run their startup**. Slush's surveys found **63% of startups** (2024) and **58%** (2025) rank fundraising among their top three challenges.

The fundraising timeline itself has stretched dramatically. Carta's platform data — covering tens of thousands of startups — shows the median time between a seed round and Series A grew from **420 days in Q4 2021 to 774 days (2.1 years) in Q4 2024**. Series B-to-C gaps hit **856 days (~2.5 years)**. DocSend and Harvard Business School's joint research found the average successful seed raise requires contacting **58 investors** and holding **40 meetings** over 12.5 weeks. Industry guidance now recommends founders assume **6–8 months** for a full fundraising cycle.

Due diligence preparation specifically adds burden through data room assembly, financial model preparation, legal document organization, and iterative Q&A with potential investors. Kruze Consulting notes that DD typically takes 2–4 weeks for well-prepared companies, but complexity increases dramatically at each successive funding round. The compounding effect is significant: longer fundraising cycles mean founders face this burden more frequently relative to their runway.

**Evidence assessment:** Strong validation. The AIN survey provides direct measurement of founder time impact. Carta's platform data on elongating fundraising timelines is the most authoritative source available. However, the specific portion of fundraising time attributable to *due diligence preparation* versus *pitching and investor outreach* is not cleanly separated in available data. The due diligence burden is real but is embedded within the larger fundraising time commitment.

## What the hypotheses missed: the deeper structural problem

Several findings were not anticipated by any individual hypothesis but illuminate a more fundamental issue.

**Audits do not prevent post-close problems.** The Euclid finding that 84% of financial statement breach claims involve audited targets and 90% of paid losses come from audited deals is perhaps the single most important data point in this research. It reveals that the problem is not one of *missing data* but of **failing to synthesize existing data**. Auditors examine financials; due diligence teams review documents; yet material issues still go undetected because no one can effectively cross-reference thousands of pages of contracts, financial statements, compliance records, and operational data simultaneously. This represents the deepest validation of the AI-powered due diligence thesis.

**The problem is accelerating, not stabilizing.** Accenture found that **75% of PE leaders** say investments have grown more complex over the past five years. Deloitte found that **43% of M&A professionals** expect due diligence demands to increase further. Meanwhile, **65% cite data quality and availability** as a leading barrier — even as the volume and complexity of data continues to grow. The gap between what due diligence requires and what manual processes can deliver is widening.

**Value destruction is the default outcome.** An academic analysis of **40,000 acquisitions over 40 years** found that **70–75% fail to create shareholder value**. PwC found that only **14% of acquirers** report significant success across strategic, operational, and financial measures. Bain attributes **~60% of deal failures** to poor due diligence. These are not edge cases — value destruction is the baseline outcome, and due diligence failure is the most commonly cited driver.

**The six hypotheses are interconnected, not independent.** H1 (manual review) causes H3 (search failures), which enables H2 (missed anomalies). H4 (fragmented workflows) amplifies all three by preventing coordination. H5 (monitoring gaps) extends the same structural problems into the post-investment phase. H6 (founder burden) is the mirror image of H1–H4, experienced from the other side of the table. The common thread is that due diligence operates on unstructured, unsearchable, unconnected information — and every hypothesis describes a different symptom of that single root cause.

## Conclusion: one root cause, six symptoms

The research validates all six hypotheses to varying degrees — five strongly, one moderately — but the most important finding is structural. **Due diligence fails because it operates on unstructured, disconnected information at a scale that exceeds human processing capacity.** Every hypothesis describes a different manifestation of this single constraint. Manual review (H1) is necessary *because* documents are unstructured. Information retrieval fails (H3) *because* manual search cannot scale. Anomalies go undetected (H2) *because* cross-referencing across thousands of pages is cognitively impossible. Teams fragment (H4) *because* there is no shared, structured data layer to coordinate around. Monitoring gaps persist (H5) *because* the same manual, batch-oriented information architecture extends into the portfolio management phase. Founders bear excessive burden (H6) *because* the investor side of the process is manual and iterative.

Three findings merit particular attention for anyone evaluating this problem space. First, the **84% audited-target claim rate** from Euclid proves that existing quality controls are insufficient — the problem is not that data doesn't exist but that humans cannot synthesize it at scale. Second, **83% of PE leaders** acknowledging their due diligence needs substantial improvement represents unusual self-awareness of a systemic failure. Third, the **widening gap** between increasing deal complexity (75% of PE leaders confirm this) and still-primitive tooling (46% Excel-only, 54% email-based data collection) suggests the problem will intensify before it improves, creating an increasingly urgent need for AI-powered solutions.

The strongest uncertainty in this research is the lack of precise data on exactly what percentage of analyst time goes to document review versus other due diligence activities, and the difficulty of isolating "workflow fragmentation" as a measurable phenomenon. Several vendor-sourced statistics (37% analyst time on searching, 73% DDQ inconsistency rate) should be treated as directional rather than definitive. The most robust data comes from insurance claims databases (SRS Acquiom, Euclid, AIG), platform data (Carta), and Big Four/consulting firm surveys (Deloitte, Accenture, McKinsey, Bain, PwC).
