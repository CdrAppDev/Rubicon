primary_segment: "S1"
rationale: >
  Buy-side PE deal teams (S1) selected as primary segment because:
  (a) Largest population of active job executors (~150,000+ underserved professionals)
  (b) Strongest evidence of current pain (66%+ of deal time on Q&A, 28% post-close claim rate, manual Excel coordination despite VDR adoption)
  (c) Most direct alignment with cross-document synthesis job (J2) and cross-workstream integration job (J3) — the defining unsolved gap in the competitive landscape
  (d) Deal-driven purchase urgency — 30-90 day windows create immediate need rather than discretionary evaluation
  (e) Land-and-expand pattern enables pilot-to-firm-wide growth within 6-12 months
  S4 (portfolio monitoring) identified as strong secondary segment with different buying cycle (continuous vs deal-driven) and quantified ROI ($100K-$170K annual savings).
