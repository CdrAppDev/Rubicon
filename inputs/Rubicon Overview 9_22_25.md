### **Use Case: M\&A Due Diligence**

#### **The Challenge**

In a mid-market M\&A deal, an investment bank and private equity buyer are working together to evaluate a target company under a tight LOI timeline. The data room contains thousands of documents—financial statements, contracts, board minutes, customer agreements, HR policies, and more.

Investment analysts are overwhelmed, combing through files manually. The legal team is behind on contract abstraction. Leadership at the target company is distracted from operations trying to field repetitive diligence questions. The PE deal team is struggling to build a confident thesis without full visibility into key risks.

#### **How Rubicon Helps**

Rubicon acts as an AI-powered "super associate" to accelerate and deepen diligence efforts:

* Rapid Document Parsing: Rubicon ingests and indexes every document in the data room—no matter the format—making the entire corpus instantly searchable.

* Smart Q\&A with Citations: Users can ask natural language questions like “Are there any change-of-control clauses in customer contracts?” or “What are the EBITDA adjustments over the last 3 years?” and receive answers with cited sources.

* Automated Red Flag Detection: Rubicon surfaces anomalies, such as revenue inconsistencies, unusual contract terms, or missing compliance documents.

* Timeline & Deal Modeling Inputs: Financial data is structured into timelines and standardized fields to streamline modeling, valuation, and scenario analysis.

* Collaboration-Ready Insights: Shared summaries, audit trails, and workspace tagging allow deal teams, legal, and executives to work from a single source of truth.

#### **The Outcome**

The deal team identifies three key risks that would’ve otherwise gone unnoticed, leading to renegotiated terms. Legal completes contract review in half the time. The target company’s leadership team can focus on operations instead of drowning in diligence requests. The deal closes faster—with more confidence and less friction.
