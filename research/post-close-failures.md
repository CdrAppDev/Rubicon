# The anatomy of due diligence failure in M&A

**Due diligence fails not because information is hidden, but because it is fragmented across thousands of pages that no human team can synthesize under deal timelines.** The evidence is now overwhelming: **84–90% of financial statement breach claims involve targets with audited financials**, and **90% of Euclid Transactional's paid losses** come from deals where audits were conducted. Even top-25 private equity firms — deploying the best advisors and the most sophisticated DD processes money can buy — generate claims at rates proportional to their deal volume. The problem is structural. Revenue recognition failures, inventory misstatements, and compliance-with-laws breaches dominate RWI claims not because these areas lack scrutiny, but because detecting them requires cross-referencing financial statements against contracts, operational data, regulatory filings, and management representations — a synthesis task that collapses under the 30-to-90-day timelines and thousands-of-documents volume typical of private M&A. This report presents the granular evidence beneath the headline statistics: the specific failure modes, the case studies, the litigation record, and the insurance industry's own assessment of what goes wrong and why.

## The three categories that drive 80% of all RWI losses

Aon's 2025 Transaction Solutions Global Claims Study reveals a striking disparity between claim *frequency* and claim *severity* that reshapes how we should understand DD failures. By frequency, the four most common breach types on North American RWI policies are compliance with laws (**20%**), tax (**17%**), financial statements (**13%**), and material contracts (**13%**) — together accounting for 63% of all claims. But by actual dollars paid, the picture inverts dramatically: financial statements drive **37% of all loss payments**, material contracts account for **31%**, and compliance with laws represents **12%**. These three categories alone consume **80% of every dollar insurers pay on RWI claims**. Tax, despite being the second-most-frequent notification at 17%, produces only **2% of paid losses** — a classic high-frequency, low-severity pattern driven by routine government audits rather than fundamental DD failures.

Marsh's 2024 Global Claims Report shows the concentration is even starker in their book: financial statement breaches comprised **45% of total payments** made to Marsh clients in 2023. The lesson is clear — deal teams face two distinct problems. Frequent but manageable claims (tax audits, employment disputes) that are largely noise, and rare but devastating claims (financial statement and material contract breaches) where each failure costs millions because it strikes at the core economic assumptions of the deal.

The fastest-growing claim categories tell the story of what's changing. **No undisclosed liabilities claims more than doubled** between SRS Acquiom's 2022 and 2024 reports, directly linked to reduced DD during the frenzied 2021 deal market. Compliance-with-laws claims surged from **7% to 17-20%** (Liberty GTS/Aon), driven by BIPA data privacy litigation, false advertising claims, and government investigations into acquired businesses. Tax jumped from **12% to 17%** of claim share (Aon, a 42% increase year-over-year), as governments aggressively pursued post-COVID tax revenues. Perhaps most consequential: claims seeking **EBITDA-multiple damages** rose from **5% in 2020 to 32% in 2024** (Fasken/Aon), meaning the financial impact of each underlying breach is being amplified by the purchase price multiplier — a $1M revenue overstatement in a company bought at 10x EBITDA becomes a $10M claim.

Industry sector matters enormously. AIG data shows compliance-with-laws breaches constitute **30% of claims** in health and pharmaceutical deals (versus 20% overall), while IP claims represent **16% of technology deal claims** and become the **second-most-severe breach type** for claims surfacing 12+ months post-close. Smaller deals (under $250M) produce disproportionate compliance claims due to targets' lack of robust compliance departments, while deals over $250M face elevated IP exposure from complex patent portfolios. Liberty GTS's 2024 Claims Briefing shows third-party claims are escalating, with **19% involving government investigations**, **13% involving wage-and-hour disputes**, and **7% involving IP litigation**.

## Inside financial statement breaches: the specific failure modes

The 37–45% of RWI loss dollars classified as "financial statement breaches" is not a monolithic category. Insurance industry data and forensic accounting literature reveal it decomposes into a consistent hierarchy of specific failure modes. Sterling Seacrest Pritchard's composite analysis of AIG, Liberty, and Euclid data identifies the definitive top three: **revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and carve-out complications** are "consistently cited as the origins of claims for breaches of financial statement reps."

Berkeley Research Group published what may be the most complete taxonomy of these failure modes in a 2024 Lexology analysis. Revenue recognition issues include timing manipulation on long-term contracts, fictitious revenue from round-trip transactions, and recorded revenue falling short of estimates due to aggressive booking of anticipated sales. Inventory problems span inflated valuations, insufficient obsolescence reserves, and — in the most extreme cases — entirely fictitious subledgers created to cover non-existent inventory (as in the Liberty subrogation case against sellers of a $140M business, where Liberty paid $12.2M in claims for phony inventory and is now pursuing personal liability against the CEO, CFO, and director of finance). Carve-out issues arise when targets being separated from parent companies have financials that were never maintained on a standalone basis, creating allocation disputes that surface post-close.

Beyond the top three, BRG identifies a broader landscape of financial statement failure modes that DD teams must detect through cross-document analysis:

- **Accounting estimate manipulation** — management discretion exploited in reserves, allowances, depreciation, and capitalization policies, where the line between "poor estimate" and fraud is thin
- **Off-balance-sheet arrangements** — hidden obligations through round-trip transactions, unusual customer incentives, and complex structures
- **Inadequate reserves and allowances** — insufficient provisions for bad debts, warranty obligations, environmental liabilities, and contingent litigation
- **Related-party transactions** — non-arm's-length terms creating hidden value extraction
- **Expense timing and capitalization** — recording operating expenses as capital expenditures to inflate EBITDA

The critical insight from BRG's analysis: "If management disregards available data because it doesn't align with their desired outcome, it could be argued that the financial statements no longer adhere to GAAP, constituting a breach of financial statement representations, irrespective of the underlying cause." This explains why audited financials don't prevent claims — **accounting estimates involve considerable discretion and subjectivity**, and sellers are motivated to optimize reported results during a sale process. The information needed to detect these issues — benchmark data, operational metrics, contract terms, customer behavior patterns — exists across multiple document types that must be synthesized, not just verified in isolation.

AIG's data reinforces this: **38% of all claim notifications** relate to accounting issues (financial statements plus tax), rising to **46% when covered losses exceed $1 million**. Financial statement fraud is the least likely type of occupational fraud at only 5% of cases, but it produces the highest losses — a median misstatement of **$766,000**, more than 3x corruption and 6x asset misappropriation losses. The rarity but severity of these failures makes them precisely the kind of risk that automated cross-document analysis could catch.

## Eight case studies where the data room held the answer

The most powerful evidence for cross-document synthesis failure comes from specific acquisitions where post-close investigations revealed that the problematic information existed in accessible form during DD — it simply wasn't connected across documents. These are not fraud cases where data was hidden. They are cases where Document A and Document B each looked unremarkable alone, but their intersection was explosive.

**Valeant/Salix ($14.5B, 2015)** represents the archetype. Salix's financial statements showed strong revenue growth. Separately, wholesaler inventory reports showed **5–9 months of excess inventory** for Salix's top four products (versus a normal 2-month level). Separately, IMS Health prescription data showed flat end-consumer demand. Any one document alone was unremarkable; cross-referencing all three revealed textbook channel stuffing. Critically, **competitor Allergan conducted the same DD and caught it**, walking away from the deal. Valeant's team acknowledged the excess inventory but proceeded anyway, eventually estimating over $500M in revenue impact.

**GE/Alstom Power ($10.6B, 2015)** produced a $23B goodwill write-down — more than double the purchase price. Alstom's own 2014 annual report contained a **footnote warning of "excess capacity in developed markets,"** published before the deal closed. Simultaneously, publicly available renewable energy LCOE data showed wind and solar costs plummeting, and gas turbine order data was already declining. GE's financial models projected robust continued demand. The financial projection team built aggressive growth models without reconciling them against the target's own operational warnings and publicly available industry data. As GE's then-CEO John Flannery later admitted: "If we can go back in a time machine today, we would pay a substantially lower price."

**Marriott/Starwood ($13.6B, 2016)** illustrates cybersecurity cross-reference failure. Starwood's reservation system had been compromised since July 2014 — two full years before the acquisition closed. Starwood had disclosed a **separate** breach in 2015. Marriott acknowledged conducting only "limited due diligence on the Starwood data processing systems and databases." Yet the prior breach disclosure, combined with Starwood's legacy IT infrastructure documentation and its inventory of **383 million guest records** including passport numbers and payment data, should have triggered intensive security assessment. Instead, these data points lived in separate workstreams reviewed by different teams. The result: **£18.4M in ICO fines**, $23.8M+ in other penalties, and over $1B in estimated revenue losses.

**Bayer/Monsanto ($63B, 2018)** may be the costliest synthesis failure in corporate history. Bayer's DD on Roundup litigation risk was "limited exclusively to memoranda by a U.S. law firm based on publicly-available documents and statements from Monsanto's representatives." At the same time, IARC had already classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic" (2015), and Monsanto was producing internal documents in the Roundup MDL that would later devastate the company at trial. Bayer never sought access to these discovery documents. The cross-reference failure: Monsanto's public assurances of safety + IARC's public classification + documents already in MDL discovery showing the company knew of cancer risks = catastrophic litigation liability that has cost over **$10B in settlements** across 67,000+ lawsuits.

**Bank of America/Countrywide ($2.5B, 2008)** demonstrates contract-versus-practice synthesis failure at scale. BofA deployed a **60-person DD team** over **90 days**. Countrywide's official Loan Program Guides, available in the data room, specified conservative underwriting standards. But internal documents later revealed in DOJ proceedings showed "shadow guidelines" that systematically approved exceptions, a July 2005 directive to allow exceptions "to the widest extent possible," and Credit Risk Committee reports noting **~15% of non-conforming loans were underwriting exceptions**. Cross-referencing the formal guidelines against actual loan characteristics in the portfolio would have revealed systematic deviation. Post-close losses exceeded **$60B**.

**Kraft Heinz (2015 merger, $15.4B impairment in 2019)** shows forensic accounting red flags hiding in plain sight. Despite declining pro forma sales and earnings, goodwill in the purchase price allocation **increased 4.9%** from initial to final estimates — a pattern that forensic analysts at Sabrient/Gradient Analytics identified as a leading indicator of impairment. Annual reports from 2015–2018 showed progressively thinning fair value premiums over carrying values. The SEC investigation eventually revealed **$208M in fictitious cost savings** and procurement misconduct requiring restatement of 2016–2017 financials. The cross-reference: purchase price allocation changes + declining brand performance metrics + consumer trend data showing shift away from processed foods = overstated synergies heading toward impairment.

## What RWI underwriters see that deal teams miss

The RWI underwriting process functions as an independent, financially-motivated quality check on buyer DD. As Woodruff Sawyer describes it: "RWI underwriters are simply reviewing the diligence that has already been conducted. Another way of stating it: **It's diligence on the diligence.**" The fact that underwriters routinely add deal-specific exclusions when DD falls short is itself evidence of systematic gaps in buyer diligence processes.

The underwriting workflow provides a revealing contrast to typical DD. Underwriters and their counsel gain access to the data room, review all DD reports and disclosure schedules, and then conduct a **2–3 hour cross-functional call** with the deal team, legal counsel, financial advisors, and tax advisors simultaneously. They follow up within 24 hours. SRS Acquiom notes that underwriters "spot-check the data room information against the sellers' disclosure schedules to ascertain their thoroughness and accuracy" — precisely the kind of cross-document verification that deal teams under time pressure often skip.

Several patterns emerge from the underwriting literature about what deal teams consistently miss. First, **underwriters reject reliance on seller representations** as a substitute for independent verification. Clifford Chance's 2024 guidance is blunt: "Underwriters do not want to hear 'we got a representation to cover that matter,' they want to understand your independent diligence." Yet deal teams frequently treat contractual reps as de facto DD, a cognitive shortcut that underwriters explicitly flag. Second, when buyers use internally prepared DD reports instead of third-party reports, Woodruff Sawyer reports that "the result could be a lengthy list of follow-up questions or, worst case scenario, an exclusion for the risk that underwriters feel did not receive adequate diligence." Third, **insurance DD** — evaluating the target's own insurance coverage adequacy — is a commonly neglected workstream. Woodruff Sawyer found that targets "typically have not performed any benchmarking analysis around limit adequacy" for cyber, business income, and product liability coverage.

Areas that trigger **enhanced underwriter scrutiny** include FCPA compliance, wage-and-hour violations, pension underfunding, union activity, healthcare reimbursement, data privacy, environmental contamination, **customer concentration**, and condition of physical assets. SSP Insurance's analysis of carrier data notes that "even with high quality diligence it can be difficult or impossible to understand the true condition of all assets, especially in capital/equipment heavy industries." This observation is critical — it identifies an inherent ceiling on what document-based DD can accomplish without operational verification.

The RWI market also reveals a troubling moral hazard. Fasken's analysis found the **18% average RWI claim rate** is "markedly higher than the rate of post-closing claims in the absence of RWI." They attribute this partly to "less thorough buyer due diligence in reliance on the RWI policy" — buyers do less work precisely because they have insurance as a backstop. Gibson Dunn identified a structural Catch-22: "The buyer will want to conduct a comprehensive diligence process so that it is fully aware of all of the target company's risks, but doing so will deprive the buyer of coverage under the policy for any liabilities that it uncovers" (because known issues are excluded). This creates perverse incentives around DD thoroughness that only automated, exhaustive analysis could resolve.

## Delaware Chancery reveals the gap between data room access and data room analysis

Ten years of Delaware Court of Chancery opinions on M&A disputes provide a judicial record of what DD should have caught. Several landmark cases directly illuminate the synthesis failure problem.

**Arwood v. AW Site Services (2022)** is perhaps the most telling. The buyer received "full and unfettered access to the businesses' raw financial and other records" during DD. Post-close, the buyer brought fraud and breach claims when the business underperformed. Vice Chancellor Slights **rejected the fraud claim**, finding that "if this buyer did not appreciate the facts it now claims were fraudulently concealed from it, that incognizance was the product of its own reckless failure to observe what was right in front of it." The data was there; the buyer simply didn't synthesize it. Yet the court upheld the breach of contract claim under Delaware's pro-sandbagging doctrine — **data room access does not equal data room analysis**, but contractual protections survive regardless.

**Akorn v. Fresenius Kabi (2018)** produced the first-ever Delaware finding that a Material Adverse Effect had occurred. Fresenius agreed to buy Akorn for $4.75B, conducted pre-signing DD, and missed pervasive FDA data integrity violations. Only anonymous **whistleblower letters** after signing revealed that Akorn had fabricated regulatory submission data, cancelled audits, and failed to maintain data integrity systems. The estimated remediation cost: **$900M, or 20% of deal value**. The court rejected Akorn's argument that Fresenius had "assumed the risk" through its pre-signing DD, reinforcing that representations contractually allocate risk regardless of what DD found. The case demonstrates that regulatory compliance DD on billion-dollar pharmaceutical deals can be surface-level even when stakes are enormous.

**IAC Search v. Conversant (2016)** exposes the gap between DD findings and contractual protection. IAC paid $90M for ValueClick subsidiaries including Investopedia, alleging that ValueClick placed false performance metrics — overstated ad impressions and understated CPM — "in documents placed in the electronic data room and in responses to due diligence requests." Chancellor Bouchard **dismissed the fraud claim** because the purchase agreement contained anti-reliance provisions: IAC had signed an acknowledgment that it was not relying on DD materials for anything beyond express contractual representations. The DD team found the metrics material enough to drive the investment thesis but **never ensured those specific metrics became contractual representations**. Information gathered in DD that doesn't flow into the contract provides no legal recourse.

**In re Dura Medic Holdings (2025)** adds another dimension. Vice Chancellor Laster held that even if sellers had disclosed compliance issues during a DD conference call, oral disclosures "would only modify representations if they appeared in the transaction documents." The court found that representations "serve to reduce due diligence costs, especially when a buyer is confronted with circumstances that may be subject to change or otherwise difficult to determine at the time of contracting." The case awarded damages calculated at a **6.7797x EBITDA transaction multiple** — meaning every dollar of undisclosed liability was multiplied nearly 7x in damages.

**EMSI Acquisition v. Contrarian Funds (2017)** reveals the "trap for the unwary." A PE buyer acquired EMSI and post-closing forensic investigation revealed the target's management had manipulated financial statements to inflate the purchase price. The selling PE fund had "neither managerial oversight nor a participatory role" in the fraud. Standard pre-closing DD failed to detect the manipulation — only **forensic-level accounting analysis** caught it afterward. The case highlights the systematic gap between standard DD (which accepts management-prepared financials) and forensic DD (which would have caught the manipulation through cross-verification).

Across these cases, a consistent pattern emerges: **Delaware courts will not rescue buyers from their own DD failures on fraud claims** (requiring justifiable reliance), **but will enforce contractual indemnification regardless of DD quality** (pro-sandbagging). This creates a paradox where the contractual framework protects against DD failures, but only up to the cap negotiated in the agreement — which is typically a fraction of actual losses in catastrophic cases.

## The academic and industry evidence that DD quality determines outcomes

Daniel Wangerin's 2019 study in *Contemporary Accounting Research* — analyzing acquisitions across multiple years — provides the definitive academic evidence. Less due diligence is associated with **(a) lower post-acquisition profitability, (b) higher probability of acquisition-related goodwill impairments, and (c) lower quality fair value estimates** for acquired assets and liabilities. Critically, Wangerin finds that competitive pressures, short-term financial reporting incentives, and agency problems are associated with less DD — the very conditions that characterize heated deal markets.

The 2021–2022 M&A cycle provides a natural experiment. Latham & Watkins documented that "compressed deal timelines and frenzied competition caused many deals to be signed with fewer buyer protections and less information about target businesses than buyers required." The aftermath has been measurable: SRS Acquiom's data shows no-undisclosed-liabilities claims **more than doubled**, and Fasken attributes the surge partly to "decreased buyer due diligence... in the competitive 2021 M&A market." The causal chain — **time pressure → compressed DD → reduced synthesis → increased post-close claims** — is now empirically documented across multiple data sources.

Bain & Company's experience across 18,000+ DD projects reveals the flip side: deeper DD creates measurable value. In one case, a global manufacturing company that conducted "outside-in diligence" using additional benchmarks, primary research, and external data scraping uncovered **more than twice the original estimate of cost synergies**, enabling a winning offer. In another, a Fortune 500 technology company used outside-in mapping of 10,000+ employees and discovered the talent base lacked the technical skills driving the investment thesis — **walking away from the deal** before closing. Harvard Business Review's foundational analysis captures the structural problem: "Due diligence all too often becomes an exercise in verifying the target's financial statements rather than conducting a fair analysis of the deal's strategic logic. Seldom does the process lead managers to kill potential acquisitions, even when the deals are deeply flawed."

Latham & Watkins identifies cross-practice synthesis as the critical gap: "Issues discovered in due diligence often relate to or overlap across multiple disciplines such as regulatory, employment, tax, and finance." Their recommendation — that "deal teams should work closely with all of their advisers and support ongoing discussions between each of them" to encourage "cross-practice information flows" — is an acknowledgment that the current siloed model structurally prevents the synthesis needed to catch multi-dimensional risks.

## Conclusion: the synthesis ceiling

The evidence assembled here points to a specific, well-documented failure mode. DD doesn't fail because buyers lack access to information, resources, or expertise. It fails because the task of synthesizing thousands of unstructured documents across financial, legal, regulatory, operational, and contractual domains exceeds what human teams can accomplish within deal timelines — even when those teams include top-25 PE firms, Big 4 advisors, and leading law firms.

The data makes this case with unusual clarity. Revenue recognized in financial statements must be cross-referenced against contract terms, wholesaler inventory levels, and prescription data (Valeant/Salix). Growth projections must be reconciled against the target's own annual report footnotes and publicly available industry cost curves (GE/Alstom). Regulatory inspection histories must be connected to revenue model dependence on market access (Daiichi/Ranbaxy). Formal underwriting guidelines must be compared against actual loan-level exception rates (BofA/Countrywide). Each of these failures involved documents that were individually reviewed but never connected.

Three novel insights emerge from this research. First, **the EBITDA-multiplier effect on damages is transforming the economics of DD failure**. With 32% of RWI claims now seeking multiple-based damages (up from 5% in 2020), every dollar of undetected misstatement is amplified by the purchase price multiple — typically 6–12x. A $2M revenue recognition error in a company acquired at 10x EBITDA becomes a $20M claim. This makes the cost of missed cross-references exponentially higher than it was five years ago. Second, **RWI underwriters already perform a crude version of cross-document synthesis** — spot-checking data rooms against disclosure schedules, conducting cross-functional calls with all advisors simultaneously — and the fact that they routinely find gaps serious enough to warrant exclusions proves the problem exists in virtually every deal. Third, **Delaware's pro-sandbagging doctrine creates a structural disincentive for DD improvement** by making contractual breach claims viable regardless of DD quality, while simultaneously punishing inadequate DD on fraud claims where it matters most. The legal framework rewards the form of contractual protection over the substance of actual verification.

The ceiling on human synthesis capacity is not a quality problem. It is a physics problem — too many documents, too many cross-references, too little time. The question is not whether this ceiling exists, but whether technology can raise it.
