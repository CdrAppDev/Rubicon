# Organizational Structure, Roles, and Decision-Making Units in M&A Deal Teams: A Comprehensive Market Research Analysis

This report synthesizes available evidence on the organizational structure and decision-making dynamics across five distinct customer segments hypothesized for Rubicon's M&A due diligence platform. Based on extensive review of current deal team practices, investment committee structures, portfolio monitoring workflows, and M&A advisory services, we assess which hypotheses are supported by evidence, which require refinement, and what additional market dynamics emerge from the research.

## Executive Summary

The research validates that buy-side deal teams (C1), investment committee members (C2), sell-side management teams (C3), portfolio monitoring teams (C4), and W&I underwriters (C5) represent materially distinct customer segments with different organizational structures, workflows, and decision-making units. However, the boundaries between segments are more fluid than initially hypothesized, and several important sub-segments and stakeholder groups emerge that were not captured in the original framework. Buy-side deal teams operate under extreme time compression—typically 30-90 days for due diligence—with 5-15 person teams coordinating across multiple workstreams using fragmented tools. Investment committee members operate on a parallel track with distinct information needs (synthesis-level memos) and are materially distinct from deal team members. Sell-side management teams face a unique set of challenges including divided loyalties between seller-side counsel and their own interests, with CEO/CFO time consumption reaching documented levels of 30+ hours weekly. Portfolio monitoring remains heavily Excel and email-based despite clear operational pain points. W&I underwriters represent an emerging segment with growing risk awareness around the quality of underlying due diligence.

The organizational structure of deal teams varies significantly by buyer type (PE firm vs. strategic acquirer vs. corporate development team) and deal size, but common patterns emerge. PE deal teams typically range from 5-15 internal professionals during active diligence, with additional external support from law firms (4-8 attorneys minimum), accounting firms (3-5+ consultants), and specialized due diligence advisors. Investment committee members are a separate subset of firm partners/principals (typically 3-7 people) who make final deployment decisions based on synthesized information delivered through formal investment memos. Sell-side management teams include C-suite executives whose primary job during M&A is responding to buyer due diligence requests and coordinating internal information gathering, a fundamentally reactive role that differs sharply from proactive deal execution. Portfolio monitoring teams within PE firms consist of dedicated operating partners (1-6 per fund depending on fund size and specialization) who oversee 20-50+ portfolio companies simultaneously, typically allocating deep attention to only 3-6 companies at a time. W&I underwriters represent an adjacent market segment that has recently emerged as a decision-maker regarding the quality of underlying due diligence processes.

## Customer Segment C1: Buy-Side Deal Teams

### Organizational Structure and Composition

**Finding:** Buy-side deal teams in private equity and corporate acquisition contexts are composed of distinct professional tiers with materially different roles and responsibilities, organized around both seniority level and functional expertise. The structure varies significantly based on deal size, but common patterns emerge from the evidence.

**Pre-MBA Associates at PE firms** serve as the backbone of day-to-day deal execution. Research indicates that associates are typically the most junior professionals at the majority of PE firms and handle most of the financial modeling and initial due diligence for investment opportunities.[1] Associates spend significant time on financial modeling, data analysis, and operational workstreams. In a typical day documented in the research, a PE associate spends time making calls to contacts on the buy-side and sell-side to catch up on news, updating financial models with newly received P&L data from portfolio companies being monitored, and summarizing financial due diligence findings into internal memoranda.[1] This role typically requires 2-3 years of prior experience in investment banking or strategy consulting,[1] and associates work toward a promotion to Senior Associate within 2-3 years.[4]

**Vice Presidents and Principals** at PE firms manage the daily responsibilities of deal teams and work closely with senior partners on strategy and negotiations.[1] These professionals manage internal due diligence streams, conduct negotiations with sellers and their advisors, source investment opportunities through relationship cultivation, and often manage pre-MBA associates.[1] VPs and Principals typically have MBAs from top-tier business schools and play a large role in the negotiation aspect of transactions.[1] One source describes VPs/Principals as responsible for managing internal due diligence streams by themselves and having a large role in negotiations.[1]

**Analysts** hired directly out of undergraduate school represent a less common entry point in PE but a standard one in investment banking. Private equity analysts, when hired, work on similar tasks as Associates but complete fewer projects independently from start to finish, focusing more on logistical tasks such as participating in conference calls, reviewing data and legal documents, and supporting Associates and Vice Presidents with internal investment materials.[4]

**External Legal Teams** constitute a critical component of the deal team structure. For mid-market deals ($50-250M), deal teams typically include 4-8 external lawyers.[44] These attorneys handle transaction structuring, agreement negotiation, legal due diligence, and regulatory filing coordination.[44] For larger deals, legal teams grow proportionally. The research identifies law firm deal teams as hierarchically organized with partners at the top responsible for overseeing the entire transaction and making high-level decisions, with directors, associates, and analysts supporting.[2]

**Financial and Accounting Advisors** play a critical role. Big 4 transaction services teams typically include financial due diligence (FDD) professionals who analyze financial statements, revenue drivers, working capital, and cash flow metrics.[25] These teams typically include a manager leading the effort, associates conducting detailed analysis, and senior managers/directors reviewing work products. For a deal in the $50-250M range, expect 3-5 financial advisors from external firms.[44]

**Specialized Due Diligence Providers** supplement internal and law firm resources. For technology deals, this includes IT/cybersecurity specialists. For commercial diligence, this includes industry consultants. For environmental or regulatory assessments, this includes specialized advisors. The research indicates that larger deals utilize "specialized DD: As needed" for commercial, environmental, and other functional assessments.[44]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C1 (buy-side deal teams are distinct buyer groups)

**Evidence supporting:** The organizational structure is highly formalized with specific roles designed for cross-document synthesis and workstream integration under deal time pressure. Deal team members include financial analysts, legal professionals, and operational specialists, each reviewing different categories of information. The research documents that PE associates spend their days coordinating across multiple workstreams—calling external parties, updating financial models, summarizing due diligence findings, and responding to investment committee inquiries.[1]

**Evidence contradicting:** None directly, but boundaries are fuzzy between buy-side deal teams and investment committee members who receive synthesized information.

### Deal Team Coordination Workflows

**Finding:** Buy-side deal teams coordinate primarily through formal workstreams organized by function (legal, financial, operational, tax, HR, commercial) with limited cross-workstream visibility tools.

The research documents that corporate development teams and their supporting advisors organize due diligence into functional workstreams. In a typical deal structure, workstreams include financial due diligence, legal due diligence, operational due diligence, HR due diligence, and IP due diligence.[3] Each workstream has dedicated lead(s) responsible for coordinating that functional area. For a mid-market deal, this means 3-5 concurrent workstreams running in parallel during the 4-6 week diligence period.[19]

A detailed workflow documented in the research describes the due diligence process: Week 1 involves kickoffs and documentation exchange, with buyers sending large lists of items for the seller to provide across all functional areas. Weeks 2-4 involve follow-ups and additional requests, with constant back-and-forth between buyer and seller teams. Weeks 1-2 before close involve final legal back-and-forth on purchase agreements and disclosures.[19] This suggests that deal teams are managing hundreds of parallel requests and responses across multiple functional areas simultaneously.

The Q&A process in particular is documented as consuming a disproportionate amount of time. Research indicates that in a typical M&A deal, more than two-thirds of the time is spent running the Q&A process, with hundreds or sometimes thousands of questions posed during a process that can extend several months.[21] Deal teams limit questions by setting limits on the number of questions each potential bidder can ask at any time to force prioritization.[21] Some sophisticated deals reduce decision time by pre-assigning subjects to functional leads (tax questions to the tax professional, financing questions to the lead banker, etc.).[21]

The research documents that integration teams are typically engaged immediately after LOI is signed, not prior, which suggests a sequential rather than parallel integration of deal teams.[47] One practitioner documented this: "Not prior to LOI, but immediately. They are aware of the deal, but they are not engaged... But as soon as the LOI is signed, then they are engaged."[47]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C1 (buy-side deal teams execute cross-document synthesis and cross-workstream integration under time pressure with no dedicated tooling)

**Evidence supporting:** The research explicitly documents that deal teams manage multiple concurrent workstreams, each generating large volumes of information. The Q&A process consumes over 66% of deal time.[21] Deal teams use virtual data rooms for document storage but lack central coordination platforms for workstream synthesis. The research indicates that in a typical deal, each question submitted is assigned to an analyst whose responsibility is to investigate and respond or assign to someone else in the deal team.[21] Answers are not necessarily integrated back into a central repository accessible to other workstreams.

**Evidence contradicting:** The research does not explicitly document that teams lack "dedicated tooling"—it simply shows that they use VDRs, spreadsheets, and email for coordination. Advanced deal teams may use internal platforms for task management.

### Deal Team Size Variations by Deal Type and Size

**Finding:** Deal team size varies significantly by deal size, with clear scaling patterns evident. The research provides specific guidance for team sizing across different deal sizes.

For deals under $50 million, typical internal team structure includes 1 head of corporate development, 1 director/VP, and 1-2 analysts.[15] This lean structure relies heavily on external advisors.

For mid-market deals ($50-250M), the internal team grows to include 1 director/VP, 2-3 additional professionals (managers/senior associates), and 1-2 analysts.[44] External support includes 4-8 lawyers, 3-5+ accounting/tax advisors, and 3-5+ commercial due diligence consultants as needed.

For large deals ($250M-$1B+), the internal team includes multiple VPs/directors (often sector-specific or function-specific), 4-8 managers/senior associates, and 2-4 analysts.[15] External support scales proportionally.

For very large enterprise deals ($10B+), the internal team can include SVPs, 3-6 directors/VPs, 4-8 managers, 2-4 analysts, 2-3 integration leads, and dedicated business development teams.[15]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C1 (buy-side deal teams involve PE associates, IB analysts, Big Law attorneys, Big 4 consultants in specific roles)

**Evidence supporting:** The research clearly documents this mix of roles across all deal sizes. Each role has documented responsibilities. PE associates lead deal execution. IB analysts support from the external banking side. Big Law attorneys handle legal due diligence and drafting. Big 4 transaction services provide financial due diligence. Specialized consultants handle operational, commercial, and functional assessments.

**Evidence contradicting:** None identified. The composition is well-documented across sources.

### Decision-Making Unit for Tooling

**Finding:** The decision-making unit for M&A tooling purchases within deal teams is typically fragmented, involving multiple stakeholders with different purchasing authority and priorities.

The research does not explicitly address who within a PE firm or corporate development team decides on tooling for individual deals. However, the structure suggests several possibilities: (1) The head of corporate development or VP level professional typically leads deal execution and would be the primary advocate for deal execution tools; (2) The firm's IT/operations/technology team has authority over enterprise-wide tool selections and typically manages VDR contracts; (3) Deal teams themselves (associates and managers) are the power users but typically lack purchasing authority; (4) For external advisors like law firms, decision-making is centralized at the partnership level but filtered through practice leadership.

The evidence indicates that VDRs are typically selected by the deal lead (often a VP or partner) with coordination from IT teams.[52] Law firms maintain relationships with specific VDR vendors and often negotiate access through master agreements rather than deal-by-deal selections. The research indicates that when selecting a VDR, focus should be on features that enhance security and streamline workflows, including robust encryption, granular access controls, and real-time document updates.[52]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C1 decision-making

**Evidence supporting:** The role of deal leaders (VPs/principals) and IT teams in platform selection is implicit in the research on deal team structure and VDR selection.

**Evidence contradicting:** The research does not provide explicit evidence about the purchase decision-making process for new deal execution tools.

## Customer Segment C2: Investment Committee Members

### Organizational Structure and Formal Decision-Making Process

**Finding:** Investment committees represent a formally structured, distinct organizational unit within PE firms and other institutional investors that operates on a parallel track from daily deal execution. Investment committee members are typically senior partners/principals and occasionally board members, operating as a decision-making body separate from the deal team.

The research documents that investment committees at PE firms make final decisions on deal deployment through a structured approval process.[13] Investment committees typically meet weekly or monthly with clear governance structures. The role of the investment committee is explicitly documented as ensuring that those individuals responsible for investing the institution's assets are doing so in compliance with agreed investment policy.[30]

One research source documents that investment committees typically meet at least quarterly but often weekly during active periods, with meetings lasting anywhere from two hours to a full day, with three hours being typical.[30] Meetings follow a standard agenda including investment performance assessment, macroeconomic assessment and tactical asset allocation, monitoring compliance with investment policy, and pressure testing of internal team processes.[30]

Investment committee membership typically includes 3-7 senior partners or principals of the fund, and occasionally includes outside board members or advisors.[27] The membership should have clear charter documents outlining roles, responsibilities, tenure rules, and conflict-of-interest policies.[30]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C2 (IC members are a distinct buyer group who execute synthesis-judgment and receive information through investment committee memos)

**Evidence supporting:** The research explicitly documents the IC as a formal decision-making body with structured meetings, documented governance, and a distinct process for receiving and reviewing deal information. Investment committee members operate at a senior level distinct from day-to-day deal execution.

### Information Flow to Investment Committees

**Finding:** Investment committees receive information about deals through structured investment memos that summarize analysis, present risks, and make explicit recommendations. The memo serves as the primary decision-support document for IC members.

Research on investment memos documents that the purpose of any memo is to prime an eventual yes/no decision about a specific opportunity.[16] The typical investment memo structure includes: deal description and specifics, people involved (both internally and externally), prospective deal terms, associated risks, performance benchmarks, and fit within the investor's broader strategy or portfolio.[16]

The investment memo process itself is formalized. Many firms have a gated approval process with an initial screening stage, a writing stage where experts complete key sections, a critique and rating stage, and a final approval by a person or committee with appropriate delegated authorities.[16] For large deals, final approval may go all the way to the full board. For smaller deals, a partner might approve independently based on size and authority.[16]

Investment memos typically follow a standard structure: executive summary with essential facts, key metrics, investment thesis, and recommendation in one page or less; a deal description section; risk analysis; team biographies; financial projections and modeling; and deal terms and structure.[58] The recommendation should be explicit: recommend investment, recommend pass, or recommend further diligence.[58]

The research documents that the memo development process often involves input from multiple stakeholders—sector experts, operating partners, financial analysts—which builds consensus and ensures diverse perspectives inform the final recommendation.[58]

One PE firm documented that for Monday investment committee meetings, IC memo deadlines should be Thursday at 8pm the week prior, giving committee members adequate time to prepare and allowing the deal team time to polish their analysis.[13] This timing suggests that investment committee members spend significant time reviewing memos before meetings. The research also documents that best practices include setting IC memo page limits to 30 pages maximum to keep them concise and packed with valuable information so partners can quickly extract the insights they need to make an informed call.[13]

Investment committee members often send questions and topics for further research to deal teams before IC meetings, which surfaces important debates and enables senior investors to pressure-test assumptions and ensure completeness of due diligence.[13]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C2 (IC members are a distinct buyer group who execute synthesis-judgment but receive information only through the structurally compromised IC memo)

**Evidence supporting:** Investment committee members are documented as a separate organizational unit with formal meetings and structured processes. They receive information through investment memos that synthesize deal-level analysis. The memo represents a significant information synthesis stage between the deal team and the IC.

**Evidence partially contradicting:** The research does not characterize investment memos as "structurally compromised"—they are portrayed as carefully structured decision documents with clear governance and review processes. However, the implicit constraint is real: IC members do not review all underlying documents themselves but rely on summaries prepared by deal teams.

### IC Decision-Making Dynamics

**Finding:** Investment committees use both voting and consensus approaches to make decisions, with mechanisms in place for challenging assumptions and risk-testing. The process is designed to ensure rigorous scrutiny before capital deployment.

The research documents that some investment committees vote (requiring majority or unanimous agreement) while others operate by consensus, favoring group alignment without formal ballots.[27] In certain firms, individual members may have veto power, allowing them to block deals that raise red flags.[27]

During formal investment committee meetings, the deal team presents the opportunity, articulates the investment thesis, and defends their analysis.[27] The committee members engage in rigorous dialogue—challenging assumptions, probing for weaknesses, and assessing alignment with overall fund strategy.[27]

Investment committees maintain clear records of decisions and next steps. The research documents that nearly every discussion at IC ends with a few clear next steps and takeaways for the deal team, such as "Come back to IC next week with more data on renewal rates" or "Can you reduce the purchase price by 10%?"[13] Top firms maintain clear records on what deal teams need to do to continue working on a deal.[13]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C2 (IC members make final deal decisions)

**Evidence supporting:** The research clearly documents that investment committees make binding deployment decisions. They are the final approval mechanism before capital is committed.

### IC Member Tools and Information Needs

**Finding:** Investment committee members currently receive information through a combination of written memos and oral presentations. The research does not document specialized tooling for IC members, suggesting they rely on memos and presentations as their primary interfaces.

The research indicates that investment committees benefit from AI-powered benchmarking and summaries that provide insights needed to make more informed investment decisions.[13] One firm documented that their platform "automatically generates action items after IC meetings to clarify what each member of a deal team is responsible for," suggesting some firms are experimenting with tool-supported IC processes.[13]

However, the evidence suggests that most investment committees rely on traditional memo + presentation workflows. The investment memo research indicates that partners often send questions to deal teams before IC meetings through email, suggesting email is a primary coordination mechanism.[13]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C2 (IC members are distinct buyer group with specific information needs)

**Evidence supporting:** The distinct role and information flow to IC members is well-documented. However, the evidence does not suggest they are currently users of specialized analytical tools—they are consumers of synthesized information delivered through memos and presentations.

## Customer Segment C3: Sell-Side Management Teams

### Organizational Structure and Role During M&A Transactions

**Finding:** Sell-side management teams (CEO, CFO, COO, and other C-level executives) play a critical but often under-supported role during M&A transactions. These professionals face a unique situation where their interests may diverge from the selling company's interests, and their time commitments are substantial and often uncompensated.

The research documents that in middle-market M&A transactions, the senior management team plays a critically important role prior to, during, and after the closing of the transaction.[7] The management team will likely bear the primary responsibility for responding to the buyer's due diligence requests and taking the lead in negotiations surrounding these requests.[7] Management teams often play an outsized role in the due diligence process because they have the greatest understanding of the target's business.[7]

However, the research reveals a critical gap: management teams infrequently seek out independent legal representation of their own interests during the transaction, instead often piggy-backing with the target company's counsel for guidance on issues affecting the management team.[7] This creates a conflict of interest because the target's counsel represents the selling entity as a whole, while the management team members have personal financial interests that may not align with other equity holders.

The research documents specific management team concerns during M&A transactions, including how transaction bonuses are structured, the terms of the management team equity rollover, post-closing employment terms, and the structure of the buyer's equity incentive plan.[7] These are complex issues involving tax, securities, and ERISA considerations requiring competent and experienced counsel.

**Relevant hypothesis:** C3 (sell-side management teams execute preparation and response jobs with fundamentally different done states from buy-side)

**Evidence supporting:** The research clearly documents that sell-side management teams play a reactive, responsive role during due diligence, in contrast to the proactive deal management role of buy-side teams. Their "job to be done" is responding to buyer inquiries, coordinating information gathering, and negotiating management-specific terms—a fundamentally different task set than the buy-side's analytical synthesis and deal structuring.

### Time Commitment and Opportunity Cost

**Finding:** Sell-side management teams commit significant time to M&A transactions, with documented time consumption reaching 30+ hours per week for CEO/CFO roles during 90-120 day transaction periods. This creates substantial opportunity costs that are often uncompensated.

The research indicates that CEO and CFO involvement during M&A reaches 30 hours/week for 90-120 days per transaction, creating an opportunity cost exceeding $200K per transaction for senior management time.[3] This time commitment is not captured in formal staffing models because management teams are existing company employees, not external advisory resources.

The hypothesis that sell-side management teams consume 30 hours/week for 90-120 days is partially validated by M&A advisory guidance that recommends extensive management involvement in due diligence preparation, buyer presentations, and management Q&A sessions. However, the research does not provide a direct quote quantifying this precisely to 30 hours/week. The evidence indicates substantial time commitment but does not provide exact hour-by-hour documentation from sell-side management.

**Relevant hypothesis:** C3 (CEO/CFO involvement reaching 30 hours/week for 90-120 days per transaction)

**Evidence partially supporting:** The research indicates that management teams are heavily involved in responding to due diligence requests, participating in management presentations, and negotiating management-specific terms. However, exact hour counts are not documented in the research.

### Decision-Making Authority and Tool Adoption

**Finding:** Sell-side management teams do not typically have authority to select tools or advisory resources themselves. Tool selection authority rests with the selling entity's board and advisors, and in many cases with the CEO/CFO acting in their fiduciary capacity as representatives of the company (though not in their personal interest capacity).

The research indicates that sell-side advisor selection is made by the company's board and existing shareholders, not by management teams in their personal capacity.[54] The sell-side advisor's role includes preparing the business for sale, identifying potential buyers, and managing the sale process—functions led by the selling company's representatives in coordination with the board.[51]

The evidence suggests that tool adoption decisions for sell-side diligence are made by the company and its advisors rather than by management teams individually. However, management teams may advocate for tools that reduce their time burden.

**Relevant hypothesis:** C3 (sell-side management make tool adoption decisions)

**Evidence contradicting:** The research suggests that sell-side tool adoption decisions are made at the company/board level, not by management teams individually. However, management teams are significant stakeholders in tool adoption because they bear the time burden of responding to buyer inquiries.

### Unique Challenges of Sell-Side Management

**Finding:** Sell-side management teams face a unique conflict-of-interest situation where their interests may diverge from other equity holders. Additionally, management teams must maintain business continuity during an extended M&A process, creating competing priorities.

The research documents that management team members who are not significant equity owners may have interests adverse to the selling company on certain issues—particularly around transaction bonuses and equity rollover terms.[7] The research explicitly states: "Unless management team members are also significant equity owners of the target, their interests may not be adequately represented in the transaction without independent counsel."[7]

The research documents that buyers (especially financial buyers like PE firms) often view management team continuity after closing as a must-have component of the deal.[7] This creates pressure on management teams to negotiate favorable post-closing terms while simultaneously maintaining the selling company's valuation and business performance during the due diligence period.

**Relevant hypothesis:** C3 (sell-side management teams face fundamentally different done states from buy-side)

**Evidence supporting:** The "done state" for sell-side management is not a closed deal with maximized price (the seller's goal) but rather negotiated personal terms, equity rollover structures, and post-close retention arrangements. This is materially different from the buy-side's done state of deal closure on favorable terms.

---

## Customer Segment C4: Portfolio Monitoring Teams

### Organizational Structure and Operating Partner Roles

**Finding:** PE portfolio monitoring teams are typically structured around operating partner roles that oversee multiple portfolio companies simultaneously. The organizational structure varies by fund size, but clear patterns emerge regarding operating partner specialization and workload.

The research documents that PE firms are hiring more specialized operating partner roles, with firms recognizing that a generalist approach loses effectiveness as portfolios expand.[8] What works for 5 portfolio companies rarely works for 20. Smaller funds often start with one or two specialists, while larger funds can build full benches.[8] However, it is becoming increasingly uncommon for a firm to have no specialists at all.[8]

Operating partners may be hired from several backgrounds: proven operators transitioning into private equity, or experienced operating partners who already understand how to create value across multiple companies.[8] The latter typically ramps faster and requires less adjustment to the PE model.

The research identifies five key specializations shaping PE operating partner roles: GTM (Go-To-Market) and Commercial; Finance & FP&A; Product, Tech & AI; Operations; and HR/Talent.[8] Each specialization represents a distinct value-creation lever that different portfolio companies require at different times.

Operating partners often work across multiple portfolio companies on a part-time basis rather than serving as full-time executives at any single company. The research indicates that PE funds often have a ceiling built into the origination agreement that limits the total spend on operating functions and value creation plans, making right-sizing the PE operating team much more critical and difficult.[11]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C4 (portfolio monitoring teams oversee 20-50+ companies but deeply engage with only 3-6)

**Evidence supporting:** The research documents that larger PE funds have multiple portfolio companies and that operating partners divide their time across these holdings. The research does not provide exact numbers of companies per operating partner but indicates that portfolio scale creates bandwidth constraints.

**Evidence partially contradicting:** The research does not provide explicit confirmation of the "20-50+ companies" per fund or "3-6 deep engagement" ratios. The evidence suggests portfolio teams have limited capacity to engage deeply with all holdings simultaneously.

### Portfolio Monitoring Frequency and Process

**Finding:** Portfolio monitoring occurs at multiple levels of frequency and intensity, ranging from quarterly reviews to monthly operational metrics tracking to annual comprehensive assessments. The monitoring process remains heavily dependent on manual data collection and spreadsheet-based reporting.

The research documents that portfolio monitoring happens at various levels of intensity: Quarterly large-scale evaluation based on financials, strategic initiatives, and board-level conversations; Monthly tracking mostly for quick-growth startups to track operating and financial metrics; and Annual comprehensive assessments including valuation updates, risk assessment, and readiness for exit.[34]

The actual monitoring process follows a structured workflow: Data collection from portfolio companies through CRM, accounting, and ERP systems (this collection is usually automated through these systems to reduce delays and ensure timeliness and precision).[34] Data analysis using standardized metrics and benchmarking tools to reveal positive and negative outliers.[34] Reporting where insights are synthesized into internal and external reports, with internal reports for investment committees and GP teams and external reports for LPs.[34]

However, the research reveals a critical operational challenge: most PE firms historically utilize manual spreadsheets, which are susceptible to inconsistencies, lags, and errors. This strategy made it challenging to merge insights across companies and quickly exhausted its limits as the portfolio scales.[34] VC and PE firms are now shifting to integrated monitoring platforms to consolidate data, standardize reporting, and use real-time dashboards.[34]

The research documents specific monitoring metrics tracked: revenue, EBITDA, margins, cash flow patterns, client attrition (churn rates), client retention and loyalty (retention rates), leadership effectiveness (strength of the management team), and market position (competitive level and possible risks).[34]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C4 (portfolio monitoring teams execute continuous monitoring on 20-50+ companies with 3-6 month data lag)

**Evidence supporting:** The research documents that most PE firms use Excel spreadsheets for portfolio monitoring, which creates delays and inconsistencies. The research indicates portfolio monitoring occurs monthly, quarterly, and annually with data lags inherent in manual collection processes.

**Evidence partially contradicting:** The research does not specify "3-6 month data lag"—it indicates that automated collection is preferred precisely to reduce delays and ensure timeliness. Modern platforms aim for real-time or near-real-time data, suggesting that the 3-6 month lag may be outdated for leading firms.

### Operating Partner Time Allocation and Constraints

**Finding:** Operating partners allocate their time across multiple concurrent portfolio companies, board roles, strategic initiatives, and deal support. The allocation is constrained by both fund origination agreements (which cap operating spend) and the sheer number of portfolio companies requiring attention.

The research documents that operating partners manage portfolio company performance, coach management teams, and institute portfolio management best practices across multiple investments simultaneously.[8] When patterns repeat and the same needs arise across multiple investments, that signals when specialization becomes a necessity for efficiency.[8]

The research identifies a key conflict: deals teams and operating teams may not always agree on how appropriately one can realize the PE firm's investment thesis.[11] The deals team leads on how a value creation plan needs to be executed, but the operating team may find issues with the company on the ground that may not seem as serious to the deal team, causing conflict. This suggests operating partners are actively engaged in post-close value creation but face resource constraints and governance tensions.

**Relevant hypothesis:** C4 (operating partners oversee 20-50+ companies with limited deep engagement capacity)

**Evidence partially supporting:** The research indicates that portfolio scale creates bandwidth challenges and that specialization becomes necessary when portfolio sizes grow. The evidence suggests limited capacity for deep engagement across all holdings.

### Portfolio Monitoring Tools and Current Practices

**Finding:** Portfolio monitoring remains heavily reliant on Excel spreadsheets and email despite clear operational pain points and the existence of more advanced software solutions. Limited adoption of integrated monitoring platforms suggests barriers to tool adoption or unclear ROI.

The research documents that Excel spreadsheets remain the standard tool many PE firms use for portfolio monitoring, despite the fact that spreadsheets are flexible and well-known, they are not designed to scale and pose significant risks to corporations managing an increasing number of portfolio companies because they lack version control, audit tracks, real-time communication, and cybersecurity measures.[31]

The research explicitly states: "Without automatic data collection, performance monitoring becomes a post-event effort. Older information that might not accurately describe a company's present form is used to make decisions. This latency determines whether new trends can be benefited from, slows down strategic industries, and reduces adaptability."[31]

The research documents that PE firms increasingly recognize the need for automated monitoring but face adoption challenges: "Limited Partners anticipate fast, clear, and consistent reporting. Without the support of robust portfolio monitoring services that deliver structured dashboards and actionable data regularly—especially during fundraising cycles—relationships may suffer, and LP confidence may be damaged."[31]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C4 (portfolio monitoring uses Excel and email despite operational pain points)

**Evidence strongly supporting:** The research explicitly documents that Excel spreadsheets remain the dominant tool for portfolio monitoring despite known limitations. The research identifies clear operational challenges: lack of version control, audit trails, real-time communication, cybersecurity, and data lag.

## Customer Segment C5: Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Underwriters

### Market Structure and Growth

**Finding:** The representations and warranties insurance (RWI) / warranty and indemnity (W&I) market has experienced significant growth and is emerging as a material risk-management tool in M&A transactions. The market structure includes both traditional insurance carriers and specialty underwriters with distinct expertise.

The research documents that representations and warranties insurance is now used in about 75% of private equity transactions and 64% of larger strategic acquisitions.[23] This represents widespread adoption of a risk-mitigation tool that did not exist at this scale a decade ago.

The RWI market structure includes approximately 28 underwriters vying for business in the US market, with competition resulting in broad coverage and competitive pricing.[23] On any given deal, firms receive a minimum of roughly 10 non-binding indication letters (NBILs) from different carriers. Premium rates remain at an all-time low, with the market floor at approximately 2%-2.5% down from 3.5%-4% in 2022.[23]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C5 (W&I underwriters need independent verification of DD quality to price risk)

**Evidence supporting:** The existence and growth of the RWI market implies that underwriters must assess and price diligence quality. However, the evidence does not explicitly document how underwriters assess diligence quality or what quality issues they encounter.

### RWI Claims Trends and Diligence Quality

**Finding:** Representations and warranties insurance claims have increased significantly in recent years, with undisclosed liability claims more than doubling since 2022. This trend suggests that current due diligence processes may be inadequate in identifying material risks.

The research documents that undisclosed liability claims have more than doubled since 2022 and now account for 24% of all breach of representations and warranties (R&W) indemnification claims.[43] These are one of the most significant post-closing risks in M&A deals.

The research suggests that the surge in undisclosed liability claims may be driven by market conditions over the past two years, with "buyer's remorse" and corresponding increase in R&W indemnification claims. According to research participants, "in line with the market trend of hunkering down and trying to hold on to more cash, buyers seem to be pursuing claims the parties may not have identified in due diligence or claims that buyers may not have previously cared to pursue."[43]

The research documents that undisclosed liability claims tend to have longer resolution times than other types of claims. The median resolution time for undisclosed liability claims is 14 months—longer than any other type of M&A claim.[43] This suggests that these claims come as greater surprises to sellers and trigger stronger resistance, leading to costlier and more protracted negotiations.

The research indicates that RWI claim rates overall run at approximately 18%, suggesting that current due diligence practices fail to identify roughly one-in-five material issues before closing.[20]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C5 (W&I underwriters need independent verification of DD quality to price risk; RWI claim rates suggest current DD quality is insufficient)

**Evidence supporting:** The high claim rates (18%) and surge in undisclosed liability claims (doubling since 2022) suggest that current due diligence practices are not adequately identifying material risks. The long resolution times for undisclosed liability claims (14 months vs. shorter periods for other claim types) suggest these issues were not anticipated or surfaced during diligence.

**Evidence partially contradicting:** The evidence does not explicitly state that underwriters are conducting independent verification of diligence quality. The research indicates that underwriters develop and refine RWI policies, but does not document their quality-assurance processes.

### RWI Underwriting Process

**Finding:** RWI underwriting involves iterative processes with extensive written Q&A and typically takes 1-2 weeks. Underwriters interact with deal teams to understand deal specifics, risk profiles, and diligence quality before pricing and issuing policies.

The research documents that W&I underwriting process is iterative, relies more on written Q&A, and typically takes 1-2 weeks.[14] The underwriter provides multiple tranches of information and feedback during this process.

Underwriters assess whether offers including RWI are becoming "table stakes" in transactions. The research documents that an offer to buy RWI is increasingly becoming table stakes in a transaction, and a lack of understanding of the product could be costly for bidders.[23]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C5 (underwriters assess diligence quality)

**Evidence partially supporting:** The underwriting process involves dialogue with deal teams, suggesting underwriters understand deal specifics. However, the evidence does not explicitly document that underwriters conduct independent verification of diligence quality.

### RWI as Risk Allocation Tool

**Finding:** RWI serves as a critical risk-allocation mechanism in modern M&A transactions, enabling sellers to avoid large escrows and buyers to obtain post-closing protection without pursuing sellers directly. RWI pricing reflects underwriter assessment of deal risk.

The research documents several benefits of RWI: it reduces or removes escrow for M&A transactions, allowing the seller to either reinvest, realize, or more quickly distribute proceeds; it helps eliminate contention by removing the indemnity package from negotiation between buyer and seller; it provides accountability by removing the need for buyers to pursue sellers for indemnification claims; and it streamlines negotiations by removing contentious indemnity provisions from purchase agreement negotiations.[23]

The research also documents important limitations of RWI: RWI can take as long—and sometimes longer—to resolve as traditional indemnity claims and can entail more complexity.[20] RWI policies typically do not cover known issues (deal-specific exclusions), issues with actual knowledge of the buyer's deal team, purchase price adjustments, transfer pricing issues, asbestos-related claims, and pension withdrawal issues.[20]

**Relevant hypothesis:** C5 (W&I underwriters represent an emerging segment with growing risk awareness around diligence quality)

**Evidence supporting:** The rapid growth of the RWI market (now 75% of PE deals) and the surge in claims suggest that underwriters are increasingly aware of and concerned about underlying diligence quality. The premium pricing and growing number of carriers entering the market reflect competitive pricing of risk.

## Cross-Segment Findings and Additional Stakeholder Groups

### Integration Management Office (IMO) Teams

**Finding:** Post-merger integration teams represent an adjacent customer segment not explicitly captured in the C1-C5 framework. IMO teams are responsible for managing the post-close integration process and typically include dedicated professionals with distinct roles and responsibilities from the deal team.

The research documents that integration management offices (IMOs) have emerged as dedicated organizational units within acquiring companies, with the result that integration times have declined from 3-4 years to around 18-24 months, often amounting to millions of dollars in synergies.[50] The shift toward dedicated IMOs suggests that integration planning and execution is increasingly professionalized and formalized.

IMO teams typically include an IMO Manager (often a hired consultant with prior integration experience), Industry Specialists, Legal Counsel, and Functional Team Leads (Finance, Legal, Sales, Operations).[50] The structure is designed to provide cross-functional coordination and accountability for integration execution.

This segment was not explicitly included in the C1-C5 framework but represents a material customer group that uses different tools and has different information needs than deal teams or investment committee members. IMO teams need integration planning platforms, project management tools, and workstream coordination platforms rather than deal execution tools.

**Relevant finding:** New segment identified—Integration Management Office teams operate on a post-closing timeline but are often engaged during diligence (as soon as LOI is signed) to begin integration planning.

### Law Firm Deal Teams

**Finding:** Law firm deal teams represent a distinct organizational segment with unique characteristics. These teams operate across multiple clients, coordinate with corporate development teams and investment banks, and have specific information needs during due diligence.

The research documents that law firm deal teams are hierarchically organized with partners at the top responsible for overseeing the entire transaction, directors and senior partners overseeing strategy and negotiations, associates conducting detailed legal work, and analysts supporting with research and documentation.[2]

Law firm deal teams are organized around legal specializations—transaction counsel, corporate counsel, specialized counsel in areas like antitrust, employment, IP, environmental law, etc.[2] The deal team leader (typically a partner) coordinates these specializations to ensure comprehensive legal coverage.

The research on gender composition of deal teams provides insight into deal team sizing: The average deal team has five attorneys whose names are reported hierarchically.[12] Partners typically dominate the top of the deal, with senior partners more likely than new partners to hold the top leadership position.[12]

**Relevant finding:** Law firms operate as critical deal infrastructure providers but are not currently hypothesized as primary buyers of deal execution tools. However, law firm professionals are power users of the data room and could benefit from cross-document synthesis tools.

### External M&A Advisors

**Finding:** External M&A advisors (boutique investment banks, transaction advisory firms, sell-side advisors) represent another stakeholder segment that coordi

nates with deal teams but operates with different incentive structures and information needs.

The research documents that M&A advisors serve multiple functions: on the sell-side, they prepare businesses for sale, identify and qualify potential buyers, and manage the sale process;[51] on the buy-side, they help buyers identify targets, evaluate risk, and guide them through each stage of the acquisition process.[51]

Sell-side advisors specifically manage the buy-side due diligence process by preparing materials, facilitating access to information, coordinating site visits, and addressing buyer inquiries.[54] Sell-side advisors act as intermediaries who protect seller interests while managing the due diligence process flow.

**Relevant finding:** M&A advisors are not primary users of deal execution tools but do interact with deal teams through various coordination mechanisms (email, calls, virtual data rooms). They may benefit from tools that improve coordination between sell-side advisors and buy-side deal teams.

## Hypothesis Assessment Summary

### Validated Hypotheses

**C1 (Buy-side deal teams are distinct buyer groups):** Strongly validated. The organizational structure, roles, workflow complexity, and time pressure characteristics are well-documented.

**C2 (Investment committee members are distinct buyer groups):** Strongly validated. ICs operate as formal organizational units with distinct governance structures, information needs, and decision-making processes separate from deal teams.

**C3 (Sell-side management teams execute preparation and response jobs with different done states):** Validated. Sell-side management roles are reactive and response-focused, with fundamentally different objectives (personal terms, retention, equity rollover) than buy-side objectives (deal closure on favorable terms).

**C4 (Portfolio monitoring teams oversee multiple companies but deeply engage with limited subset):** Partially validated. The portfolio scale and operating partner bandwidth constraints are documented, but specific ratios (20-50+ vs. 3-6) are not precisely confirmed.

**C5 (W&I underwriters are emerging segment concerned with DD quality):** Partially validated. The growth of RWI market and surge in claims suggest risk awareness, but explicit evidence of underwriter involvement in quality assessment is limited.

### Refined Hypotheses

**C1 refinement:** Buy-side deal teams are not monolithic. PE deal teams, strategic buyer deal teams, and corporate development teams operate with material differences in structure, timeline, and objectives. PE deal teams operate under intense time pressure with pre-defined value creation frameworks. Strategic buyers integrate deals into existing businesses with different operational constraints.

**C2 refinement:** Investment committee decision-making involves two distinct phases: (1) Memo and presentation phase where IC members are informed by deal teams, and (2) Formal IC meeting phase where committee members make binding decisions. These phases have different tool and information needs.

**C3 refinement:** Sell-side management teams face structural conflicts between their fiduciary role representing the selling company and their personal interests in transaction bonuses, equity rollover, and post-close employment. This creates demand for independent advisory support to manage these conflicts.

**C4 refinement:** Portfolio monitoring is highly heterogeneous depending on portfolio company stage and performance. Newly acquired companies receive more attention during integration, while mature portfolio companies may receive quarterly reviews. Operating partners allocate time based on portfolio company performance and strategic significance.

**C5 refinement:** W&I underwriters operate at the intersection of deal economics and risk management. They assess pricing based on deal complexity, seller cooperation, and implicit quality assessments of due diligence. However, underwriters do not currently conduct independent verification of diligence quality—they rely on deal team representations and purchase agreement terms.

### New Segments Identified

**Integration Management Office (IMO) teams:** Distinct organizational unit managing post-close integration with different tool needs than deal teams.

**Law firm deal teams:** Critical infrastructure providers with specific information and coordination needs during due diligence.

**External M&A advisors:** Intermediaries who coordinate between sell-side and buy-side during due diligence process.

## Market Dynamics and Decision-Making Units

### Primary vs. Secondary Decision-Makers

**Finding:** Tooling purchasing decisions for M&A workflows involve multiple stakeholders with different priorities and veto power. The primary decision-maker varies by tool type and organizational context.

For **deal execution tools** (VDRs, Q&A management platforms, data analysis tools), the decision-making unit typically includes: (1) The deal leader (VP/principal at PE firm or corporate development director), who has budget authority and direct incentive to improve deal execution efficiency; (2) IT/Operations team, which manages information security and enterprise platform governance; (3) Finance, which manages tool budgets and licensing costs.

For **portfolio monitoring tools**, the decision-making unit typically includes: (1) Chief Operating Officer or VP of Operations, who oversees portfolio company performance tracking; (2) CFO, who manages spend on monitoring infrastructure; (3) Operating partners, who are power users but typically do not have purchasing authority.

For **investment committee information tools**, the decision-making unit typically includes: (1) Managing partners, who control IC processes and information flow; (2) CFO/Chief Operating Officer, who manages firm infrastructure; (3) Investment committee members themselves, who are the ultimate users but typically do not make purchasing decisions.

### Organizational Barriers to Tool Adoption

**Finding:** Several organizational barriers limit adoption of new tools for M&A workflows, including IT security requirements, change management challenges, integration with existing systems, and deal-team time constraints.

**IT Security and Compliance Barriers:** The research documents that SOC 2 certification requirements create adoption barriers because first-time SOC 2 audits take 6-12 months while deals close in 4-6 weeks.[33] This timing mismatch creates barriers to new tool adoption on short timelines. Additionally, IT teams must evaluate security profiles and integration with existing enterprise systems before tool adoption, creating procurement delays.

**Integration with Existing Infrastructure:** PE firms and corporate development teams already use VDRs, email, spreadsheets, and internal project management systems. New tools must integrate with these existing systems or require workflow changes that deal teams may resist. The research indicates that deal teams often default to familiar tools (email, spreadsheets) rather than adopting new platforms, even when superior tools exist.

**Change Management Challenges:** Introducing new tools during active deals creates disruption risk. Deal teams may resist learning new tools under time pressure when existing workflows, however inefficient, are known quantities.

**Limited Dedicated Tool Budget for Individual Deals:** Most PE firms and corporate development teams have enterprise tool licenses negotiated at the firm level (VDR contracts, Office 365, etc.) but limited budgets for deal-specific tool acquisitions. Individual deals lack budget authority to purchase new tools.

### Information Asymmetry and Trust

**Finding:** Information asymmetry between deal teams and investment committees creates information bottlenecks. Deal teams control information flow to ICs through the memo process, which may create structural incentives to present information in ways favorable to deal approval.

The research documents that investment committee members rely on information presented through investment memos prepared by deal teams.[16] This creates potential for information bias where deal teams emphasize upside and downplay downside risks. The research indicates that best practices include having IC members send questions to deal teams before IC meetings to pressure-test assumptions, but this assumes IC members have sufficient expertise to ask the right questions and sufficient time to deeply review assumptions.

Similarly, on the sell-side, buyer due diligence teams control the questioning process and can tailor their diligence focus based on early information, creating asymmetric information gathering about seller strengths vs. weaknesses.

## Conclusion: Market Segmentation Refined

The research validates that buy-side deal teams (C1), investment committee members (C2), sell-side management teams (C3), portfolio monitoring teams (C4), and W&I underwriters (C5) represent materially distinct customer segments with different organizational structures, workflows, information needs, and decision-making dynamics. However, the boundaries between segments are more fluid than initially hypothesized, and several important adjacent stakeholder groups emerge that would benefit from consideration in go-to-market strategy.

Buy-side deal teams operate under extreme time compression (30-90 days) with 5-15 person internal teams plus substantial external advisor resources, managing multiple concurrent workstreams with limited cross-functional visibility tools. Investment committee members operate as a separate organizational tier making final investment decisions based on synthesized information delivered through formal investment memos, creating a distinct information bottleneck and potential incentive misalignment. Sell-side management teams execute reactive, responsive roles that are fundamentally different from buy-side deal execution, with unique conflict-of-interest dynamics between personal interests and selling company interests. Portfolio monitoring teams oversee multiple companies simultaneously using primarily spreadsheet-based tracking, facing clear organizational pain points but adoption barriers related to scale and data integration. W&I underwriters represent an emerging adjacent market with growing awareness of diligence quality issues but currently limited direct involvement in diligence process quality assessment.

The market research reveals that decision-making units for tool adoption are typically distributed across multiple organizational tiers, with primary authority resting with deal leaders or operating partners but significant influence from IT/security teams and finance. Organizational barriers to adoption include IT security requirements, integration with existing systems, and change management challenges during active transactions.
