    rationale: >
      Three independent WTP signals converge on $20K-$240K per deal: existing infrastructure
      spend ($10K-$200K), labor savings from DD compression ($96K-$240K), and claim prevention
      value ($70K expected value). Price sensitivity is low for demonstrated ROI. Budget category
      is "replacing existing" (reducing advisory hours and VDR spend) rather than net-new line item.
      Portfolio monitoring WTP anchored separately to labor replacement economics.
