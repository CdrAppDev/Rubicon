    problem: "Due diligence teams must manually review thousands of unstructured documents under tight deal timelines, making thorough analysis impractical within the time available"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Value prop: 'Enterprise-grade AI associate trained to analyze vast volumes of documents from data rooms, virtual deal rooms, and business systems'"
      - "Testimonial: 'accelerated due diligence' — implies current process is too slow"
      - "Testimonial: 'significantly cutting operational costs' — implies current process is expensive"
      - "Feature: AI-assisted forensic analysis — implies manual forensic analysis is the baseline"
    falsifiable: true

  - id: H2
    problem: "Financial anomalies and risk signals buried in deal documents go undetected during due diligence because reviewers cannot systematically cross-reference information across large document sets"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Feature: 'AI-assisted forensic analysis to build financial timelines, audit trails, and surface anomalies'"
      - "Value prop: 'reduce risk' — implies risk is currently missed"
      - "Feature: anomaly surfacing — implies anomalies currently go unsurfaced"
    falsifiable: true

  - id: H3
    problem: "Finding specific information across thousands of unstructured pages in deal data rooms requires excessive time, leading to incomplete analysis or missed findings"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Feature: 'Instantly searches thousands of unstructured document pages across multiple sources'"
      - "Feature: 'Delivers concise answers with source citations' — implies analysts currently read through documents to find answers"
      - "Pain point listed: 'Information access across thousands of documents'"
    falsifiable: true

  - id: H4
    problem: "Due diligence work across analysts, legal teams, and leadership is fragmented, resulting in inconsistent risk assessments and duplicated review effort"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Feature: 'Shared workspaces across teams'"
      - "Feature: 'AI-generated summaries for consistency and confidence in deal workflows' — 'consistency' implies current inconsistency"
      - "Testimonial: 'supporting analysts, legal team, and leadership' — multiple distinct roles involved"
    falsifiable: true

  - id: H5
    problem: "Portfolio managers lack continuous visibility into portfolio company health between formal reporting periods, creating blind spots for emerging risks"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Target audience: 'Investors/Portfolio managers (monitoring companies 24/7)'"
      - "The 24/7 framing implies current monitoring is periodic, not continuous"
    falsifiable: true

  - id: H6
    problem: "Startups preparing for investor due diligence spend excessive founder time organizing documents and responding to information requests, diverting attention from building the business"
    evidence_signals:
      - "Target audience: 'Start-ups (seeking to raise capital and communicate with investors)'"
      - "Feature: document organization and search — implies current document preparation is manual and burdensome"
