# Customer Voice

## Theme 1: The Crushing Weight of Manual Review

> "during the due diligence/benchmarking/data analysis part of it I wanted to kill myself. Sounds like just a hell of a lot of pain in the ass work. Any tips on how to mitigate the pain and make life easier for yourself (vis a vis data room stuff)?"
> — Wall Street Oasis, IB analyst

> "a lot of mind-numbing redactions... Most importantly, when you're in this stage of execution, your inbox will be blowing up all day long and everything will need to get done 20 minutes ago. So you don't have time to get much else done until late at night. This is when the burnout phase begins."
> — Wall Street Oasis, IB associate

> "diligence is when you really start to hate your life and get jaded. That's when you start realizing that this job is stupid and if you could go back and meet your year-ago-college-senior self you would kick your own ass for even considering IB."
> — Wall Street Oasis, IB associate

> "M&A sucks. I hate diligence"
> — Glassdoor, Big Law senior associate

> "By being super organized, you'll make your life easier, but it's still going to suck."
> — Wall Street Oasis

> "No work life balance (70 hours week during busy season and 50 hours in off peak is a norm)"
> — Glassdoor, PwC Financial Due Diligence

> "The bread and butter of what analysts and associates do is really grunt work, Excel monkey work that should be done at the snap of a finger."
> — Osman Ghandour, Co-founder of Soal Lab

> "The work was rather mundane and menial. The workload is so heavy for staffers that they prefer to push off simple tedious tasks to the interns, hence you don't get much real work experience."
> — Glassdoor, Deloitte

> "We burn out our best junior talent by forcing them to spend their weekend manually keying numbers from PDFs into Excel, praying they don't transpose a digit in the EBITDA bridge due to sleep deprivation."
> — V7 Labs, 2025

> "Diligence reviews often come with familiar pain points: hundreds or thousands of agreements, inconsistent document sets, and a tight deadline. Associates spend hours combing through contracts to find key clauses, and then manually copy them into a spreadsheet or chart."
> — Andrew Johnston, Harvey AI (former associate at Goodwin Procter, Blakes, and Stikeman Elliott)

> "You should review every page of every document provided and note any potential issues."
> — ABA Young Lawyers Division, instruction to junior associates

> "One in five BigLaw associates report feeling emotionally depleted by their work."
> — Unmind/ABA Journal survey of 3,800+ lawyers, 2024

## Theme 2: Search as Needle-in-a-Haystack

> "While DataSite offers a secure environment for document sharing, the process of reviewing files is frustratingly slow. Navigating through files one by one is time-consuming, especially in larger data rooms with hundreds or thousands of documents. There's no efficient way to skim or bulk-review file contents."
> — Capterra, Datasite user review

> "I worked on a project which required me to find number of bank account customers and credit card customers for 5 banks in 8 countries. Annual report and company website didn't show the numbers and it sucked spending 2 whole day on it and you ended up guesstimating by using doubtful news source."
> — Wall Street Oasis, consulting analyst

> "we all know how challenging it can be to find documents with unclear names in a dense VDR"
> — G2, Ideals VDR user (verified investment banking)

> "Disclosure schedules may be the death of me."
> — Glassdoor, Big Law community

> "The search feature doesn't always work. Versions of documents don't live together, rather they are uploaded as 'copy' which can get messy."
> — Capterra, Intralinks user review

> "search accuracy sometimes misses relevant text. Usability for new users isn't always intuitive."
> — G2, Datasite user review

## Theme 3: Herding Cats Across Teams

> "It's definitely like herding cats. Upwards of 100 people, between advisors and internal folks. I believe, fundamentally, that time kills deals; so you have to be as efficient as possible."
> — Rob Humble, SVP Strategy & Corporate Development, IAS (Colonnade Advisors Podcast)

> "I've received several due diligence question lists from various parties hired by the acquirer to conduct different aspects of the DD (i.e. legal, financial, commercial, etc.). All the lists are in different formats and file types (excel and word)."
> — Wall Street Oasis, sell-side M&A professional

> "the diligence teams you're hiring are only keyed in on one aspect of the deal. Need people who have a better view of everything to review and decide based on the facts what you agree with or want and what needs to further be investigated."
> — Wall Street Oasis, PE professional

> "Each call is an hour and you could end up doing 20 of them, and these always occur months later when you are on another case and if you are really lucky, the person who built the model has left the firm for b-school."
> — Wall Street Oasis, consulting professional

> "Managing Intralinks became a full-time job. Training others on how to use Intralinks took up so much time — again, this time should have been used for completing the due diligence process. Eventually, due to the ongoing issues, all parties involved in the due diligence process agreed that Intralinks was slowing the process and was unusable. We are talking about smart Accountants, lawyers, bankers, and business executives all had the same conclusion."
> — Capterra, Intralinks user review

> "Firms and their advisers tend to structure diligence as a series of discrete questions about the target company's strategy, its commercial prowess or its cost structure, as if those things had no connection to each other. Often they do not compare notes or share intelligence."
> — Bain & Company, Global M&A Report 2020

> "the biggest mistake companies make in M&A is having a disconnected diligence and integration team. When this happens, the diligence team will review the target company thoroughly and throw everything over to a team that has no knowledge about the target company."
> — Amy Weck, VP of M&A and Integrations, The Liberty Company Insurance Brokers

> "How does your firm manage diligence request lists coming from all corners of the buyside? It seems to be common place for all workstreams (legal, tax, IT, financial, etc.) to just pass excel sheets back and forth which is so unorganized / inefficient and driving me insane."
> — Wall Street Oasis, first-year analyst

## Theme 4: Missing What Matters

> "in reality the PE diligence process can be skewed especially in time-sensitive or competitive processes where a deal just needs to get done according to the senior guys. You'll be surprised how many bad investments PE firms make even when diligence has not fully supported moving forward with confidence."
> — Wall Street Oasis, PE professional

> "You would be shocked by how little due diligence we perform."
> — VC founding partner to IntegrityRisk International, September 2022

> "I'm your business confessor, for all the ugly and dirty and you-wanted-to-hide-it-under-the-bed (items; it's) time to talk about it because it will come out later, and the worst thing is to not be prepared for when that happens, so we need to know everything."
> — Gina Cocking, Managing Director, Colonnade Advisors

> "'Fear of missing out' on the next Google pressures VCs to cut corners, shorten periods they conduct due diligence, and eliminate usual protections."
> — IntegrityRisk International, September 2022

> "Due diligence is a manual process and is, thus, susceptible to human bias in the evaluation process. Analysts often bring their own preconceived notions and biases to decision-making."
> — Acuity Knowledge Partners

> "Due diligence all too often becomes an exercise in verifying the target's financial statements rather than conducting a fair analysis of the deal's strategic logic. Seldom does the process lead managers to kill potential acquisitions, even when the deals are deeply flawed."
> — Harvard Business Review

> "Underwriters do not want to hear 'we got a representation to cover that matter,' they want to understand your independent diligence."
> — Clifford Chance, 2024 RWI guidance

> "If this buyer did not appreciate the facts it now claims were fraudulently concealed from it, that incognizance was the product of its own reckless failure to observe what was right in front of it."
> — Vice Chancellor Slights, Delaware Chancery, Arwood v. AW Site Services (2022)

## Theme 5: Portfolio Monitoring in the Dark

> "In effect, investors are flying blind at precisely the time when vigilance matters most."
> — MSCI Research, 2024-2025

> "For years, Excel was the default operating system for PE monitoring. Even today, many funds still live in spreadsheet purgatory—collecting PDFs from CFOs, manually reconciling KPIs, and copy-pasting numbers into quarterly board decks. That approach isn't just inefficient—it's a liability."
> — Dealert.ai, 2025

> "None of this administrative work makes me a better investor. My core skill is to find good companies to invest in. It's not a good use of time to spend hours worrying about compliance or administration."
> — J.B. Handley, Co-founder of Bochi Investments (via Carta)

> "We've been held hostage by our own data due to an over-reliance on spreadsheets and maintaining disparate databases."
> — Cobalt client testimonial

> "The way we do our portfolio review one-pagers is mostly last-minute. We're like looking at two different screens, one of the PDF of the board deck, and then we're plugging in the numbers manually... it is cumbersome."
> — VC analyst (via PortfolioIQ)

> "Once the oversight ended, then it was party time for Steward."
> — John McDonough, Harvard Professor, on Steward Health Care/Cerberus (PBS, 2024)

> "Many fund managers lack real-time oversight of their portcos, primarily relying on quarterly reports and meetings with the portco management team."
> — BDO, 2025 Private Equity Survey

> "a deal team associate may spend an entire workday chasing down updates for a single portfolio company"
> — Chronograph, on Excel-based portfolio monitoring

> "Just give us a good Excel file so we can easily upload the data."
> — LP to Rundit, on portfolio reporting frustration

## Theme 6: The Sell-Side Burden

> "Expect this to be a full-time job for one of the founders or executives for months. You need someone strong who can handle 18-hour days, midnight calls with lawyers, and dealing with countless requests."
> — Alejandro Cremades, fundraising expert

> "I have been advising middle market companies on M&A for nearly twenty years and nearly all founders hold themselves together well during the process only to break during the due diligence."
> — M&A advisor, Quora (20 years experience)

> "Fundraising isn't just about pitching well; it's about surviving due diligence. Plenty of founders assume that once an investor is interested, the hard part is over. Wrong. It's just beginning. Due diligence is where good deals go to die."
> — Thunder.vc

> "For a founder, it can feel invasive and exhausting. If you are unprepared, this phase can drag on for months, killing your momentum and distracting you from running the business."
> — Numberly.io

> "Due diligence takes valuable time away from you concentrating on your business, and that's what makes it so painful for many founders."
> — DocSend

> "You are still expected to run the business as normal... You are probably not going to have your team helping you. If the sale of your business is going to be confidential and your team is not involved, you can't just load them up with strange work."
> — Exit Your Way

> "Most would rather give birth, have to run into a burning building to save a kitten, or have all of their teeth pulled. At least the pain would be over much faster."
> — DocSend, founder testimonial

> "The M&A sale process is typically all-consuming. It's very distracting from a business operational standpoint. From the business operator's standpoint, it's also seemingly chaotic."
> — Justin Pinto, Partner, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP

> "due diligence becomes a second full-time job. Most diligence periods aim for 60 days, but realistically, 90 to 120 is often more achievable, especially if you want to maintain sanity and value."
> — IEI Advisors, 2025

> "Selling your business and running your business are two full-time jobs. Something is bound to slip at the wrong time."
> — G-Squared Partners

> "If performance dips during the diligence period, it can jeopardize valuation, delay closing, or even kill the deal."
> — IEI Advisors, 2025

> "Expect heavy CEO and CFO involvement — up to 30 hours a week — during these six weeks."
> — SilMinds/Sampford Advisors, 2025

## Theme 7: Tools That Create New Problems

> "What a horrible experience. The due diligence process is stressful enough — Intralinks totally compounded this stress. We encountered bugs, clunky, and unnecessarily complicated user interface for both administrators and users."
> — Capterra, Intralinks user review

> "It appears to centralize and simplify a process that's often messy and email-heavy."
> — G2, DiligenceVault review

> "I've noticed reviewers mention the absence of a built-in progress tracker, leading them to rely on spreadsheets for document tracking."
> — G2 editorial, Ideals VDR

> "I should be able to mark the documents I intend to / have reviewed. It should be possible to both allocate and see who has been allocated documents on the site."
> — G2, Datasite user review

> "Bulk downloads over 1gb often have truncated file names, losing reference numbers - this means data must be downloaded in chunks of 1gb or less."
> — G2, Ansarada user review

> "It looks amazing in the sales demo but struggles with the messy reality of their own documents."
> — Luminance user (paraphrased from Nevada State Bar review)

> "Traditionally, the due diligence process is completed across various tools — using a virtual data room to store all documents, Excel trackers for listing requests and tracking progress, and one-off emails for back-and-forth deal-specific communication. Unfortunately, this leaves room for inefficiencies such as version control worries, miscommunication, duplicate work, and information silos."
> — Kison Patel, CEO, DealRoom

> "A VDR often becomes a passive digital filing cabinet. Analysts and lawyers still pour countless hours into reading and summarizing documents manually."
> — V7 Labs, 2025

## Theme 8: AI Trust Deficit

> "It only requires a couple of inaccurate results for legal teams to lose faith in a new tool entirely."
> — SpotDraft, via Artificial Lawyer

> "We need a lot of examples to train it and also that the more variety you give the system the less accurate it becomes."
> — Kira Systems user, via Artificial Lawyer (24-firm review)

> "We piloted a general-purpose legal AI tool to a subset of our lawyer bench. We assumed our lawyers, who are smart, tech-forward professionals, would figure out how to extract value from it. We were wrong. Adoption stalled within weeks."
> — Axiom Law

> "DDs are always urgent and at the start of the matter. Until lawyers get over the learning curve, they feel like their old way of doing things is easier."
> — Luminance user, via Artificial Lawyer

> "We have been engaged on this project for almost 3 years and expect to be able to test Luminance on real projects during next year."
> — Law firm, via Artificial Lawyer (on Luminance adoption timeline)

> "Lawyers' uncritical reliance on content created by a GAI tool is risky — and almost certainly malpractice."
> — NCBE Bar Examiner, citing ABA Opinion 512 (July 2024)

> "Organizing the data to be effectively engaged with by legal tech is a very time-consuming process in itself — at times organizing the data to be analysed by the legal tech could take up more time than the analysis itself."
> — Artificial Lawyer, 2025

> "It needs to be out-of-the-box. Ready to go."
> — Legal operations director, on DD AI tool requirements

## Theme 9: The Q&A Coordination Nightmare

> "There is nothing more frustrating than receiving requests for the same documents from multiple parties, leading to inconvenient repetitive work."
> — Marsha Lewis, DealRoom

> "There's nothing more frustrating to a seller than getting asked for the same information multiple times!"
> — Klint C. Kendrick, PhD, SPHR, The HR Practitioner's Guide to M&A Due Diligence

> "It's not the buyer's job to comb through 1000 random uploads to see which one answers question #678."
> — M&A practitioner, on Q&A workflow frustration

> "With the number of people involved in an M&A deal and different people from different departments touching the spreadsheet, errors will likely occur. One wrong formula, formatting, or data entry can wreak havoc."
> — DealRoom

> "With 10-20 buyers at this stage of the process, you will exhaust yourself if you answer every request for information."
> — Vista Point Advisors

> "Trust us, the buyer will ask for everything they need and 50% more."
> — Vista Point Advisors

> "Speed, communications, transparency, and coordination are key drivers of effective diligence, and these demand more robust tools than spreadsheets and emails."
> — M&A Leadership Council

> "Fast answers don't just move the timeline along, they show that the seller is serious and ready to close. Delayed responses can make buyers nervous."
> — Lake Country Advisors

## Theme 10: The Structural Impossibility of Cross-Workstream Synthesis

> "The biggest impediment to all-source analysis — to a greater likelihood of connecting the dots — is the human or systemic resistance to sharing information."
> — 9/11 Commission Report, 2004

> "The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably."
> — Atul Gawande, The Checklist Manifesto

> "The NASA organizational culture had as much to do with this accident as the foam."
> — Columbia Accident Investigation Board

> "Maintaining team alignment throughout the deal is challenging, as teams lose sight of the big picture and become consumed by individual tasks."
> — M&A Science

> "Issues discovered in due diligence often relate to or overlap across multiple disciplines such as regulatory, employment, tax, and finance."
> — Latham & Watkins

> "Integration planning is frequently the most underdeveloped aspect of due diligence."
> — Bain & Company

> "companies that operate as a collection of silos commit the cardinal sin of underperforming relative to the resources they have invested"
> — Morten Hansen, collaboration research
